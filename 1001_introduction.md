# Introduction: Leaders that are not like the world

There is not a lot of information in the New Testament about the structure and function of the early church. We cannot find an exact plan in the Bible about how we should run our churches. Much of what we do in churches is from two thousand years of church history.

Not everything we do in the church comes directly from the Bible. That does not necessarily mean that these things are good or bad. We need to take what little we know from the Bible and compare it to our modern practices to see if we are following the principles laid out in the Bible.

We have to be careful that we do not copy the ideas of the world and use them in the church. As Christians, we should not look to business leaders or politicians as examples of leadership, but church leaders will be different from the leaders of natural things. What the world thinks of as a good leader is not what the Bible says is a good leader:

> Matthew 20:25–26  
> But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.  
> But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;

There are also many things from our current church culture that does not come from biblical principles, but are things that were implemented by leaders who wanted to increase their power over others. When we go into our study, we have to clear our minds of all the things that we think about leadership so that we can be ready to learn what the Bible really says about leadership.

## The things that matter to us don't always matter to God

### The number of people is not as important as spiritual growth

Matthew 7:13-14 makes it clear that there will not be many people who enter the kingdom of heaven. As a leader in the church, you should not be focusing on getting many people into the church, but you should focus that the people you do have under your authority grow up spiritually (Ephesians 4:11-13). Of course we can do outreach ministry to the lost, but what good is it if people come to church and remain spiritually immature?

### Spiritual gifts are not as important as right relationship with God

Some leaders look to have great power with God, but it is more important that we actually know who God is. Jesus said that in the last day, there will be people who will stand before the judgment and boast of all the miracles that they did. God will tell them to go away because He never knew them (Matthew 7:21-23).

## What is a leader?

### A leader is servant of all

In all four Gospels, Jesus tells his disciples that they are supposed to be servants:

1. Matthew 20:20-28
2. Mark 9:33-37; 10:35-45
3. Luke 22:24-27
4. John 13:12-17

### A leader is to be a shepherd

A leader cares for the needs of others. The command is given two times in the New Testament for the leaders of the church to be shepherds of the flock of God (1 Peter 5:1-4; Acts 20:28). Jesus also told Peter to feed His sheep (John 21:15). The shepherd is one who takes care of all needs of the sheep, including making sure they have food and water and protecting them (Psalm 23).

<!--Jesus is our example as the good shepherd.

Hirelings-->

#### The shepherd takes care of spiritual needs

<!--Grow by the Word-->

#### The shepherd takes care of physical needs

Caring for physical needs of people is a neglected aspect of Christian ministry, because like the apostles, we say we cannot leave the preaching of the Word to serve tables. But they still made sure the people were fed, even though they did not do it themselves. They found other leaders who could do that work (Acts 6:1-8).

Jesus not only taught the people, but He also gave them physical food (Matthew 15:29-32).

<!-- James and pure religion . Cannot only say be warm (James 2:15-17). Jesus condemming the people who do not help the poor (Matthew 25:35-36, 40). The early church having all in common (Acts 4:32-35). 1 John (1 John 3:17-18). Paul taking up a collection for the poor saints in Jerusalem. The leaders were to be hospitable-->

<!--Matthew 25:35-36, 40
"For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me... Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."
Luke 10:30-37 (The Good Samaritan)
Jesus tells the story of a man who was beaten and robbed, then helped by a Samaritan who "bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him."
James 2:15-17
"Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, 'Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,' but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead."
Acts 4:32-35
"All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had... There were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need."
1 John 3:17-18
"If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth."
Romans 12:13
"Share with the Lord's people who are in need. Practice hospitality."
Galatians 6:10
"Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers."
Luke 3:11
"John answered, 'Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.'"
Acts 20:35
"In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
1 Timothy 5:8
"Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."
1 Timothy 6:17-18
"Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share."
2 Corinthians 8:13-15
"Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality. At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. The goal is equality, as it is written: 'The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.'"
Hebrews 13:16
"And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased."
Philippians 2:4
"Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others."
Matthew 6:2-4
"So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."
Acts 11:29-30
"The disciples, as each one was able, decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea. This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul."

Ephesians 4:28
"Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share with those in need."-->

### A leader is to be an example

Hebrews 13:7 (NIV)
7 Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.

Hebrews 13:17 (ESV)
Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.

1 Timothy 4:12 (NIV)
12 Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity.

We should want other people immitate us and follow in what we do.

> 1 corinthians 11:1
> Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.

1 Peter 5:3

### A leader builds up
