# Leaders and money

# Viongozi na pesa

## What is the purpose of offerings in the New Testament?

## Lengo la sadaka ni lipi katika agano jipya?

We must remember that today we use some words in a different way than they were used in the Old Testament. Today, when we say "offering," we mean money. In the Old Testament, the "offering" was not money, but animals, grain, fruit, or drinks.
Tunatakiwa kukumbuka kuwa leo tunatumia baadhi ya maneno katika njia tofauti kuliko yalivyokuwa yanatumika katika agano la kale. Leo,tukisema”sadaka”, tunamaanisha pesa. Katika agano la kale,”sadaka”haikuwa pesa, bali wanyama,nafaka,matunda au vinywaji.

The sacrificial system in the Old Testament included both regular (daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly) sacrifices and various occasional sacrifices:
Mfumo wa dhabihu katika agano la kale unahusisha yote mara kwa mara (kila siku, kwa wiki,kwa mwezi au kwa mwaka) dhabihu na dhabihu za matukio mbalimbali:

Daily Sacrifices: Each offering consisted of a year-old male lamb, along with grain and drink offerings (Num. 28:3-8).

1.  Dhabihu za kila siku:Kila sadaka ilijumuisha kondoo dume wa mwaka, pamoja na nafaka na sadaka za vinywaji (Hesabu 28:3-8).
2.  Weekly Sacrifices: Additional sacrifices were made on the Sabbath (Num. 28:9-10).
3.  Dhabihu za wiki:Dhabihu za ziada zilitolewa kwenye sabato (Hesabu 28:9-10).
4.  Monthly Sacrifices: At the beginning of each month (new moon), special sacrifices were offered (Num. 28:11-15).
5.  Dhabihu za mwezi:Mwanzoni mwa kila mwezi (mwezi mpya),dhabihu maalum zilitolewa (Hesabu 28:11-15).
6.  Annual Sacrifices: Special sacrifices were prescribed for festivals throughout the year.
    - Passover/Unleavened Bread (Num. 28:16-25)
    - Festival of Weeks/Pentecost (Num. 28:26-31)
    - Festival of Trumpets (Num. 29:1-6)
      4.Dhabihu za mwaka:Dhabihu maalumu ziliamriwa kwa sherehe mwaka mzima.
      -Pasaka/mkate usiotiwa chachu (Hesabu 28:16-25)
      -Sherehe za wiki/pentekoste (Hesabu 28:26-31)
      -Sherehe za tarumbeta (Hesabu 29:1-6)
    - Day of Atonement (Num. 29:7-11; Lev. 16)
      -Siku ya upatanisho (Hesabu 29:7-11; Mambo ya walawi 16)
    - Festival of Tabernacles (Num. 29:12-38)
      -Sherehe za hema (Hesabu 29:12-38)
7.  Additionally, individuals would bring personal sacrifices for various occasions such as:
    - Sin and guilt offerings when they transgressed (Lev. 4-7)
    - Thanksgiving offerings for blessings received (Lev. 7:12-15)
    - Offerings related to vows (Num. 15:3)
    - Purification offerings after childbirth or illness (Lev. 12-15)
8.  Kwa kuongezea,watu binafsi wangeleta sadaka binafsi kwaajili ya matukio tofauti tofauti kama:
    -Dhabihu za dhambi na hatia wakiwa wamevunjika (Mambo ya walawi 4-7)

- Sadaka za shukrani kwaajili ya Baraka zilizopokelewa (Mambo ya walawi 7:12-15)
  -Sadaka zinazohusiana na ahadi (Mambo ya walawi 15:3)
  -Sadaka za utakaso baada ya mtoto kuzaliwa au ugonjwa (Mambo ya walawi 12-15)

The offerings were for different purposes:
Sadaka zilikuwa kwaajili ya malengo tofauti tofauti:
Atonement for sin (Lev. 4:20; 16:30)

1.  Upatanisho wa dhambi (Mambo ya walawi 4:20;16:30)
2.  Expressing gratitude (Lev. 7:12; Deut. 26:10)
3.  Kuonyesha shukrani (Mambo ya walawi 7:12;Kumbukumbu la torati 26:10)
4.  Worship and devotion (Lev. 1:9; Ps. 51:19)
    3.Kuabudu na ibada (Mambo ya walawi 1:9;Zab 51:19)
5.  Fellowship with God (Lev. 7:15-16; Deut. 12:7)
6.  Ushirika na Mungu (Mambo ya walawi 7:15-16;Kumbukumbu la torati 12:7)
7.  Ritual purification (Lev. 12:6-7; 14:19-20)
8.  Ibada ya utakaso (Mambo ya walawi 12:6-7;14:19-20)
9.  Maintaining the sanctuary (Num. 18:8; Ex. 30:16)
    6.Kudumisha utakatifu (Mambo ya walawi 18:8;Kut 30:16)
10. Covenant renewal (Ex. 24:5-8; 2 Kings 23:3)
    7.Kuhuisha agano (Kut 24:5-8; 2Fal 23:3)

The priests and other Levites were not to have their own farms, so they depended on the tithes and offerings to survive. The main way that they lived was through the tithe, which was completely given to the Levites (Num. 18:21-28). The tithe would not be brought to the temple, but gathered together by the Levites in each town (Neh. 10:37-38). There was also a special tithe every three years that was not only for the Levites, but also for foreigners, orphans, and widows (Deut. 14:28-29). The priests in the temple also ate part of some of the offerings:
Makuhani na walawi wengine hawakutakiwa kuwa na mashamba yao, hivyo walitegemea mafungu ya kumi na sadaka ili kuishi. Njia kuu ambayo walitegemea ili kuishi ni zaka (mafungu ya kumi), ambazo zilitolewa zote kwa walawi (Mambo ya walawi 18:21-28). Zaka zisingeletwa hekaluni, bali zilikusanywa pamoja katika kila mji (Neh 10:37-38). Kulikuwa pia na zaka maalumu kila miaka mitatu na hizi hazikuwa tu kwaajii ya walawi, bali pia kwaajili ya wageni,yatima na wajane (Kumb 14:28-29). Makuhani katika hekalu pia walikula sehemu ya kati ya baadhi ya sadaka:

**Burnt Offerings**: These were completely consumed by fire on the altar, so nobody ate them (Lev. 1:9).

1.  ** Sadaka za kuteketezwa**:Hizi ziliteketezwa kabisa kwa moto juu ya madhabahu,kwa hiyo hakuna aliyekula (Mambo ya walawi 1:9).
2.  **Grain Offerings**: A portion was burned on the altar, but the remainder was given to the priests to eat (Lev. 6:16-18)
3.  **Sadaka za nafaka**:Sehemu iliteketezwa juu ya madhabahu,bali iliyobaki ilitolewa kwa makuhani wale (Mambo ya walawi 6:16-18)
4.  **Peace Offerings**: These were shared three ways. A portion was burned on the altar for God, certain parts were given to the priests (Lev. 7:31-34), and the remainder was eaten by the worshipper and their family.
    ** Sadaka za Amani**:Hizi walizishiriki katika njia tatu.Sehemu iliteketezwa juu ya madhabahu kwa ajili ya Mungu,sehemu Fulani ilitolewa kwa makuhani (Mambo ya walawi 7:31-34),na sehemu iliyobaki ililiwa na washirika na familia zao.
5.  **Sin Offerings**: For most sin offerings, the priests were to eat the meat in the sanctuary area (Lev. 6:26). 4.** Sadaka za dhambi**:Kwa sadaka nyingi za dhambi, makuhani walitakiwa kula nyama katika mahali patakatifu(Mambo ya walawi 6:26).
6.  **Guilt Offerings**: Similar to sin offerings, the priests were to eat these in a holy place (Lev. 7:6).
7.  ** Sadaka za hatia**:Kama sadaka za dhambi,makuhani walitakiwa kula hii katika mahali patakatifu (Mambo ya walawi 7:6).

## What is the purpose of offerings in the New Testament church?

## Lengo la sadaka katika kanisa la agano jipya ni lipi?

### The offerings were symbols that pointed forward to Christ

### Sadaka zilikuwa alama zilizoelekeza mbele kwa Kristo

Many things in the temple worship were symbols that were fulfilled in the life and person of Christ. Jesus did not come to destroy the Law of Moses, but to fulfill it (Matt. 5:17-20). Because He fulfilled the Law, we no longer follow all the rules of sacrificing animals.
Vitu vingi katika hekalu la kuabudia vilikuwa alama ambazo zilitimizwa katika maisha na mtu wa Kristo.Yesu hakuja kuitangua torati ya Musa, bali kuitimiliza (Math 5:17-20). Kwa kuwa aliitimiza torati,hatufuati tena sheria zote za kuteketeza wanyama.

#### Christ offered His life for our sins

#### Yesu aliyatoa maisha yake kwaajili ya dhambi zetu

Jesus came as the Lamb of God, Who would take away the sin of the world (John 1:29; 1 Pet. 1:18-19). When Jesus died on the cross, He became the final sacrifice for sins (Heb. 9:26; 10:11-14).
Yesu alikuja kama kondoo wa Mungu, ambaye angeichukua dhambi ya ulimwengu (Yohana 1:29;1 Pet 1:18-19).
Yesu alipokufa msalabani, alifanyika dhabihu kwaajili ya dhambi zetu (Heb 9:26;10:11-14).

#### We offer our lives to Christ

#### Tunayatoa maisha yetu kwa Kristo

There were offerings of thanks in the Old Testament. For us as Christians, we do not just give a portion of our possessions as thanks, but we give our entire lives to God to use as He wills (Rom. 12:1). This includes **everything** we own, and not just a portion of it. When we give our possessions to help other people, they are like sacrifices to God (Heb. 13:16; Phil. 4:18). Our praise also is a sacrifice to God (Heb. 13:15; 1 Pet. 2:5).
Kulikuwa na sadaka za shukrani katika agano jipya.Kwetu sisi kama wakristo,hatutoi tu sehemu ya mali zetu kama shukrani, bali tunayatoa maisha yetu yote kwa Mungu atutumie kama apendavyo (Rum 12:1).Hii inahusisha **kila kitu**tunachokimiliki, na sio tu sehemu yake.Tunapotoa tulivyonavyo kusaidia wengine,ni kama dhabihu kwa Mungu (Ebr 13:16;Fil 4:18).Sifa zetu pia ni dhabihu kwa Mungu (Ebr 13:15; 1 Pet 2:5).

The churches in Macedonia were poor, but they wanted to help the people in Judea who were poor and hungry because of famine. It was said of them that they gave themselves first to the Lord and then they gave themselves also to help the poor (2 Cor. 8:5). Later in this chapter, we will talk more about this famine and how the church helped in that time of trouble.
Makanisa ya Makedonia yalikuwa masikini,lakini walitaka kusaidia watu wa Yudea ambao walikuwa masikini na wenye njaa kwasababu ya njaa.Ilisemekana kwamba kuhusu wao waliyatoa maisha yao kwanza kwa Mungu na pia waliyatoa maisha yao kusaidia masikini (2 Kor 8:5).Baadaye katika mlango huu,tutaongea Zaidi kuhusu njaa na kanisa lilisaidiaje wakati huo wa shida.

### It does not matter the amount of the offering, but the heart

### Haijalishi kiwango cha sadaka bali ni moyo

In Mark 12:41-44, we see the story of when Jesus watched the people bring the money to give to the temple. Many people were bringing large amounts of money. There was one woman who gave only two small coins. This was not a big value, but it was **all she had**. Jesus told His disciples that this woman gave more than everyone else because she gave all that she had (See also Luke 21:1-4). Paul repeated this idea when he told the church in Corinth that "if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have" (2 Cor. 8:12).
Katika Marko 12:41-44,tunaona hadithi ya Yesu alipowaangalia watu wakileta pesa kutoa hekaluni.Watu wengi walikuwa wanaleta pesa nyingi.Kulikuwa na mwanamke mmoja ambaye alitoa tu sarafu mbili.Hii haikuwa na thamani kubwa,lakini ilikuwa **kile alichokuwanacho**.Yesu akawaambia wanafunzi wake mwanamke huyu ametoa Zaidi kuliko wengine wote kwasababu alitoa kile alichokuwa nacho (Angalia pia Luka 21:1-4). Paulo alirudia wazo hili wakatialipoliambiakanisa kule Korintho kuwa “Kama utayari ukiwapo,sadaka inapokelewa kulingana na kile alichonacho mtu,sio kulingana na kile asichokuanacho mtu”(2 Kor 8:12).

Jesus said that it was good for people in the Jewish religion to give the tithe, but there were things that were more important, such as judgment, mercy, and faith (Matt. 23:23).
Yesu alisema kuwa ilikuwa vizuri katika dini ya kiyahudi kutoa zaka,lakini kulikuwa na vitu ambavyo vilikuwa na umuhimu Zaidi,kama vile hukumu,rehema na imani(Math 23:23).

If our heart is not right, we should take care of that first before bringing a gift to God (Matt. 5:23-24).
Kama mioyo yetu haina haki,tunatakiwa tushungulikie hilo kwanza kabla ya kuleta sadaka kwa Mungu(Math 5:23-24).

When we give, we should make sure we have a good reason for giving in our heart. We should not give because we feel we have to, but we should give with a cheerful heart to be a blessing to God and to other people (2 Cor. 9:6-7).
Tukitia,tunatakiwa tuhakikishe tuna sababu nzuri ya kutoa katika mioyo yetu.Hatutakiwi tu kutoa kwasababu tunahisi kuwa ni lazima tutoe,bali tunatakiwa tutoe kwa moyo wenye furaha ili iwe Baraka kwa Mungu na kwa watu wengine(2 Kor 9:6-7).

#### Give with no expect of return

#### Toa bila kutarajia kurudishiwa

When we give to people, we give it as to God and we do not expect anything in return (Luke 6:35; 14:12-14). We do not give to get blessings, but we give to say thanks to God for what He has already done for us (2 Cor. 9:12).
Tukitoa kwa watu,tunatoa kama kwa Mungu na hatutarajii kurudishiwa chochote(Luka 6:35;14:12-14).Hatutoi ili tubarikiwe,bali tunatoa kumrudishia Mungu shukrani kwa yale ambayo ameshafanya kwetu(2 Kor 9:12).

There are many preachers that like to say that if you give money to God, then He will give you ten times that money back. Luke 6:38 is a major verse that they use to preach this:
Kuna wahubiri wengi ambao wanapenda kusema ukitia pesa kwa Mungu. Mungu naye atakupa mara kumi ya pesa uliyoitoa. Luka 6:38 ni mstari mkuu ambao wanapenda kuutumia kuhubiri hii:

If we read the verses around this, we see it is part of a larger conversation about how we interact with our neighbors and enemies (v. 24-37). Jesus said to give without expect of return (34-35). There is an aspect of judgment from God based on how we treat others. Because it says "it shall be given to you" does not necessarily mean kind for kind. When we give, God will give good things to us, though it is likely spiritual blessings (1 Tim. 6:17-19; Eph. 1:3; Acts 20:35). Psalm 41:1-3 also shows how God will bless those that give to the poor with protection and health.
Tukisoma maandiko yaliyo karibu na hili,tunaona ni sehemu ya maongezi marefu kuhusu jinsi tunavyohusiana na majirani zetu na maadui (mstari wa 24-27).Yesu alisema tutoe bila kutegemea malipo (34-35).Kuna dhana ya hukumu kutoka kwa Mungu inayohusiana na vile tunavowatendea wengine.Kwasababu inasema”Mtarejeshewa” haimaanishi hasa ukarimu kwa ukarimu.Tukitoa,Mungu atatupatia vitu vizuri,japokuwa ni labda Baraka za rohoni (1 Tim 6:17-19;Efe 1:3;Matendo 20:35).Zaburi 41:1-3pia inaonyesha jinsi Mungu atakavyowabariki wale wanaotoa kwaajili ya masikini kwa kuwalinda na kuwapa afya.

Luke 14:14 says that when we give, we should not look for something in return immediately, but we "will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous." Matthew 25:31-35 also show that our reward for giving will be in the new heaven and earth.
Luka 14:14 inasema kuwa tunapotoa, hatutakiwi kutarajia kupata kitu wakati huo huo,bali “tutalipwa katika ufufuo wa wenye haki.”Math 25:31-35 pia inaonyesha kuwa malipo ya utoaji wetu yatakuwa katika mbingu mpya na dunia.

While God may give us spiritual blessings, we are not buying them with our offerings. We cannot buy spiritual things (Acts 8:9, 13, 18-20).
Kwakuwa Mungu anatupa Baraka za kiroho, hatuzinunui kwa matoleo yetu.Hatuwezi kununua vitu vya rohoni (Matendo 8:9,13,18-20).

#### God blesses us so we can give to others

#### Mungu anatubariki ili tutoe kwa wengine

If we do receive physical or financial blessings from God, they are not for us to keep for ourselves, but that we can keep giving (2 Cor. 9:8-11). Romans lists giving as one of the spiritual gifts, alongside prophesy and teaching (Rom. 12:8). There will be some people in the church that will be blessed with wealth so that they can help other people.
Kama tunapokea Baraka za kimwili au za kiuchumi kutoka kwa Mungu,si zetu wenyewe,ni ili tuendelee kutoa (2 Kor 9:8-11).Orodha katika Warumi inatupa moja ya karama ya rohoni,kando na unabii na kufundisha (Rum 12:8).Kutakuwa na baadhi ya watu katika kanisa ambao watabarikiwa na utajiri ili wawasaidie watu wengine.

James warns the rich about the coming judgment because they did not help the poor (James 5:1-3) and so did Jesus (Matt. 25:41—46).
Yakobo anawaonya watu matajiri kuhusu hukumu inayokuja kwasababu hawajasaidia masikini (Yakobo 5:1-3) na hata Yesu pia (Math 25:41-46).

#### We give to God and not so man can see

#### Tunatoa kwa Mungu na sio ili mwanadamu aone

Jesus taught that when we give, we should not give so that people can see (Matt. 6:1-4). We do not even let our left hand know what our right hand is doing. That means that we should give and forget about it. Do not go home and think that you are very righteous for your giving.
Yesu alifundisha kuwa tukitoa,hatutakiwi kutoa ili watu waone (Math 6:1-4).Haturuhusu hata mkono wetu wa kushoto ujue mkono wetu wa kulia unafanya nini.Hii inamaanisha kuwa tunatakiwa kutoa na kusahau kuhusu tulichotoa.Usiende nyumbani na kufikiria kuwa wewe ni mwenye haki sana kwa kutoa kwako.

We see this attitude of people in weddings and send-offs. People will dance with their gift showing everyone what they are giving. But would they give the same thing if there was no one looking?
Tunaona huu mtazamo wa watu kwenye harusi na kuagwa.Watu watacheza na zawadi zao wakimuonyesha kila mtu wanachotoa.Lakini je wangetoa kitu hicho hicho kama hakuna mtu anayeangalia?

### The collections in the church were for the poor

### Makusanyo ndani ya kanisa yalikuwa kwaajili ya masikini

In the first century, there was a famine in Judea (Jerusalem and the surrounding cities and villages). The churches outside of Judea decided that they should help the people in Jerusalem, so they gave money to Paul and Barnabas to bring back to Jerusalem (Acts 11:27-30).
Katika karne ya kwanza,kulikuwa na njaa Yudea(Yerusalemu na miji pamoja na vijiji vilivyozunguka).Makanisa nje ya Yudea yaliamua kuwa wanatakiwa kuwasaidia watu wa Yerusalemu,hivyo walitoa pesa kwa Paulo na Barnaba kuzipeleka Yerusalemu(Matendo 11:27-30).

This was a very important task for the church. When the apostles in Jerusalem sent Paul and Barnabas to go preach to the gentiles, they told them to also make sure that they continue to remember the poor (Gal. 2:9–10). The work of preaching works together with the work of helping the poor.
Hii ilikuwa kazi ya muhimu kwa kanisa.Wakati mitume wa Yerusalemu walipomtuma Paulo na Barnaba kwenda kuhubiri kwa mataifa,waliwaambia pia wahakikishe kuwa wanaendelea kuwakumbuka masikini(Gal 2:9-10).Kazi ya kuhubiri inakwenda sambamba na kazi ya kusaidia masikini.

The christians thought it was important to help the Jews in Judea because the Christians received a spiritual blessing from them. The Jews had been the keepers of the Word and covenant of God. Since the Jews gave a spiritual blessing, it was good to give them a natural blessing in return (Rom. 15:26–27).
Wakristo walifikiri kuwa ilikuwa muhimu kusaidia wayahudi kule Yudea kwasababu wakristo walipokea Baraka za rohoni kutoka kwao.Wayahudi wamekuwa watunzaji wa maneno ya Mungu na agano la Mungu.Kwa kuwa wayahudi walitoa Baraka za rohoni,ilikuwa vizuri kuwapa mambo ya mwilini kama malipo(Rum 15:26-27).

In both letters to the Corinthians, Paul wrote to them about this collection:
Katika barua zote kwa Korintho,Paulo aliwaandikia kuhusu makusanyo haya:

They were to collect money on the first day of the week (1 Cor. 16:1).

1.  Walitakiwa kukusanya pesa katika siku ya kwanza ya wiki(1 Kor 16:1).
2.  Each person should give a sum of money keeping with their income. That is, those that were rich were expected to give more than those that were poor (1 Cor. 16:2; 2 Cor. 8:12).
3.  Kila mtu lazima aweke akiba kwake kwa kadri ya kufanikiwa kwake(1 Kor 16:2; 2 Kor 8:12).
4.  Paul gave them testimony about how the churches in Macedonia gave:
    - They were poor, but still gave generously with "overflowing joy" (2 Cor. 8:1–2).
    - They gave as much as they were able to, even beyond their ability (2 Cor. 8:3).
    - They pleaded to be able share in "this service to the Lord’s people" (2 Cor. 8:4).
5.  Paulo aliwapa ushuhuda wa jinsi makanisa ya makedonia yalivyotoa:

- Walikuwa masikini,lakini walitoa kwa moyo wa kupenda”kwa furaha iliyofurika”( 2 Kor 8:1-2)
- Walitoa kwa uwezo wao na hata Zaidi ya uwezo wao( 2 Kor 8:3).
  -Walituomba sana na kutusihi kwa habari ya neema hii,na shirika hili la kuwahudumia watakatifu(2 Kor 8:4).

4. They excelled in spiritual gifts, so they should also excel in giving (2 Cor. 8:7).
   4.Walikuwa na wingi wa karama za rohoni,hivyo wanatakiwa pia watoe kwa wingi(2Kor 8:7).
5. Paul did not force them to give, but wanted them to give out of love (2 Cor. 8:8).
   5.Paulo hakuwalazimisha kutoa,lakini aliwataka kutoa kwa upendo (2 Kor 8:8).
6. Jesus is our example in giving, because He was rich, but He became poor so that we could be rich (2 Cor. 8:9).
   6.Yesu ni mfano wetu katika kutoa, kwasababu alikuwa tajiri,lakini alifanyika maskini ili sisi tuwe matajiri (2Kor 8:9).
7. They had started giving the year before, and Paul encouraged them to help finish the project (2 Cor. 8:10–11).
   7.Walianza kutoa kabla ya mwaka, na Paulo aliwatia moyo kusaidia kumaliza mpango (2 Kor 8:10-11).
8. The goal of the collection was equality. It would be difficult for the Corinthians to give to help the poor in Judea, but at the time the Judeans needed the money more than the Corinthians did. There might later come a time when the Corinthians churches need help and the Judean churches would be able to return the help (2 Cor. 8:13–15).
   8.Lengo la kukusanya lilikuwa usawa. Ingekuwa ngumu kwa wakorintho kutoa kusaidia maskini huko Yudea, lakini wakati huo wayudea walihitaji pesa Zaidi ya wakorintho walivyohitaji. Ungekuja wakati ambao makanisa ya wakorintho wanahitaji msaada na makanisa ya wayudea wangeweza kurudisha fadhila (2Kor 8:13-15).
9. They should give as generously, and not grudgingly (2 Cor. 9:5, 7).
   9.Wanatakiwa kutoa kwa ukarimu, na sio kwa unyimivu (2Kor 9:5,7).
10. If they give little, they will receive little (2Cor. 9:6).
11. Kama wakitoa kidogo,watapokea kidogo (2 Kor 9:6).
12. If they give, God will increase their "store of seed" and "enlarge the harvest of [their] righteousness." This signifies both material and spiritual reward (2 Cor. 9:8–10).
13. Kama wakitoa, Mungu ataziongeza:ghala zao za mbegu” na “kuongeza mazao ya haki zenu”.Hii inadhihirisha karama za rohoni na vitu (2 Kor 9:8-10).
14. The material reward that they get from God is so that they will be able to keep giving (2 Cor. 9:11).
15. Thawabu za vitu wanazozipata kutoka kwa Mungu ni ili waweze kuendelea kutoa (2Kor 9:11).
16. Their giving not only helps people, but is a form of thanks to God (2 Cor. 9:12).
17. Utoaji wao hauwasaidii tu watu, bali ni aina ya shukurani kwa Mungu(2 Kor 9:12).
18. Their giving will also cause other people to give thanks to God (2 Cor. 9:13–15).
19. Utoaji wao pia utasababisha watu wengine kutoa shukrani kwa Mungu (2 Kor 9:13-15).

If you want to know more about the collection for the poor in Judea, read 1 Corinthians 16:1–4, 2 Corinthians 8:1-15, 9:1-15, and Acts 24:17.
Kama unataka kujua Zaidi kuhusu makusanyo kwa ajili ya maskini kule Yudea,soma 1 Kor 16:1-4,2Kor 8:1-15,9:1-15 na Matendo 24:17.

This is the only specific time in the New Testament where we see the church asking for money, and it was not for themselves, but for other people who were poor.
Huu ndio muda pekee mahusisi katika agano jipya ambao tunaona kanisa likiomba pesa,na sio kwaajili yao wenyewe bali kwaajili ya watu waliokuwa maskini.

### Not only do we give in a collection in the church, but we give to the poor when they ask

### Sio tu kwamba tunatoa katika makusanyo katika kanisa, lakini tunatoa kwaajili ya maskini wanapohitaji

Sometimes we give in church and we think that we don't need to give any more. But the New Testament makes it clear that a large part of our giving should be our own personal contributions to the poor:
Wakati mwingine tunatoa katika kanisa na tunafikiri kuwa hatuhitaji kutoa tena.Lakini agano jipya linaweka vizuri kuwa sehemu kubwa ya utoaji wetu unatakiwa uwe mchango wetu kwaajili ya masikini:

Give to him that asks (Matthew 5:42; Luke 6:30).

1.  Toa kwa yule anayekuomba (Math 5:42;Luka 6:30).
2.  If you have two shirts, give to someone who has none (Luke 3:11).
3.  Ukiwa na mashati mawili,mpatie mwingine asiyenalo (Luka 3:11).
4.  Sell your possessions and give to the poor (Matt. 19:16-22; Luke 12:33-34).
5.  Uza mali zako uwape maskini (Math 19:16-22;Luka 12:33-34).
6.  We do not have the love of God if we do not help the poor (1 John 3:17-18).
7.  Hatuna pendo la Mungu kama hatusaidii maskini (1 Yoh 3:17-18).
8.  It is not enough just to say spiritual words to people and not help them materially (James 2:15-16)
9.  Haitoshi tu kusema maneno ya rohoni kwa watu na kutokuwasaidia kwa vitu (Yakobo 2:15-16).

Dorcas is an example of a Christian who was always helping the poor (Acts 9:36).
Dorkasi ni mfano wa mkristo ambaye mara zote alisaidia maskini (Matendo 9:36).

## The church is supposed to share with each other

## Kanisa linatakiwa lishirikiane na wengine

After the day of Pentecost, the believers shared all their possessions and gave what they did not need to the poor (Acts 2:44-45; 4:34-35). They sold their land and gave the money to the apostles to use to help the poor.
Baada ya siku ya pentekoste, waamini walishirikiana mali zao na kutoa wasichokihitaji kwa maskini (Matendo 2:44-45;4:34-35).Waliuza ardhi zao na kuwapatia mitume pesa kutumia kusaidia maskini.

There was a married couple named Ananias and Sapphira. They sold their land to bring the money to the apostles. They wanted to keep some of the money, but they also wanted the recognition for giving all their money to the poor. They lied and said that what they brought was all the money. Because of their lying, they died. Their sin was not keeping something back, but lying about it. This teaches us that this giving is voluntary. God wants us to give because we want to, and not because we are forced to (Acts 5:1-11).
Kulikuwa na wanandoa walioitwa Anania na Safira.Waliuza ardhi yao ili kuleta pesa kwa mitume.Walihitaji kuzuia kwa siri sehemu ya pesaa,lakini pia walihitaji kutambuliwa kuwa walitoa pesa zote kwa masikini.Walidanganya na kusema kuwa walichokileta ndio pesa zote.Hii inatufundisha sisi kuwa kutoa ni kujitolea.Mungu anataka tutoe kwasababu tunataka,na sio kwasababu tumelazimishwa kutoa(Matendo 5:1-11).

Paul encouraged the church to help each other (Romans 12:13; Galatians 6:9-10). His goal was that there would be equality in the church (2 Cor. 8:13-15).
Paulo alilitia kanisa moyo kusaidiana (Rum 12:13;Gal 6:9-10).Lengo lake lilikuwa kuwepo kwa usawa ndani ya kanisa (2 Kor 8:13-15).

## Should pastors get money for their work?

## Je wachungaji wapate pesa kulingana na kazi yao?

We saw that in the Old Testament, the Levites did not own lands or farms, so they needed the tithes and offerings to live. But what does that mean for the New Testament? We have also seen that leaders come from God and are good for the building up of the church. If they are doing the work of God, how will they find the way to live?
Tumeona hiyo katika agano la kale,walawi hawakumiliki mashamba,hivyo walihitaji zaka na sadaka ili waishi.Lakini hiyo inamaanisha nini kwa agano jipya?Pia tumeona kuwa viongozi wanatoka kwa Mungu na ni wazuri kwa ajili ya kulijenga kanisa.Kama wanafanya kazi ya Mungu,watawezaje kupata namna ya kuishi?

### Leaders should not be looking for money

### Viongozi hawatakiwi kuangalia pesa

In all three of the lists of requirements for leaders in 1 Timothy chapter three and Titus chapter one say that the leader "should not be greedy for money" (1 Tim. 3:3, 8; Titus 1:7) and Peter also agreed with this (1 Pet. 5:2).
Katika orodha zote tatu za mahitaji kwaajili ya viongozi katika 1 Timotheo mlango wa tatu na Tito mlango wa kwanza inasema kuwa kiongozi”hatakiwi kuwa mlafi wa pesa”(1 Tim 3:3,8;Tito 1:7) na Petro pia alikubaliana na hili(1 Pet 5:2).

This is because money is dangerous. 1 Timothy 6:6-10 teaches that the love of money is the root of all evil. Jesus said that it is very hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of God (Mark 10:23-25). This is because if we already have all that we need, then we will not trust in God to help us (Luke 6:24; Pro. 30:7–9).
Hii ni kwasababu pesa ni hatari.1 Timotheo 6:6-10 inatufundisha kuwa kupenda pesa ndio shina la mabaya yote.Yesu alisema kuwa ni ngumu sana kwa tajiri kuuingia ufalme wa Mungu (Marko 10:23-25).Hii ni kwasababu kama tayari tunavyo vyote tunavyohitaji,basi hatutamwamini Mungu kutusaidia (Luka 6:24);Mith 30:7-9).

### We should not try to sell the gospel

### Hatutakiwi kujaribu kuuza injili

There were some false teachers who tried to make a profit off the Gospel (1 Tim. 6:5; Titus 1:11). This is not good because salvation is a gift from God (Romans 3:23-24; 5:15-17; 6:23; 2 Corinthians 9:15; Ephesians 2:8-9; 1 Peter 1:18-19; Revelation 22:17). Jesus said that we should freely give, because we have freely received (Matt. 10:8). We do not sell the Word of God for profit (2 Cor. 2:17).
Kulikuwa na baadhi ya walimu wa uongo waliojaribu kujipatia faida kupitia injili (1 Tim 6:5;Tito1:11).Hii siyo nzuri kwasababu wokovu ni zawadi kutoka kwa Mungu (Rum 3:23-24;5:15-17;6:23;2 Kor 9:15;Efeso 2:8-9;1 Petro 1:18-19;Ufunuo 22:17).Yesu alisema kuwa tunatakiwa tutoe bure,kwasababu tumepewa bure (Math 10:8).Hatuuzi neno la Mungu kwa faida (2 Kor 2:17).

### In theory, it is good for church workers to find money for their labor

### Katika nadharia, ni vizuri kwa watendakazi wa kanisa kutafuta pesa kwa nguvu zao

Paul taught that it was good to take care of leaders in the church. He quotes from
Deuteronomy 25:4 and says "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain" and from Deut 24:15 when he says "Workers deserve their wages" (1 Timothy 5:17-18). If we receive instruction from teachers, then it is good to give material things back to them (Gal. 6:6).
Paulo alifundisha kuwa ilikuwa vizuri kuwajali viongozi katika kanisa.Alinukuu kutoka Kumbukumbu la torati 25:4 na kusema”Ng’ombe apurapo nafaka usimfunge kinywa”anaposema”Mtendakazi astahili ujira wake”(1 Timotheo 5:17-18).Kama tukipokea maelekezo kutoka kwa walimu,basi ni vizuri kuwapatia vitu(Gal 6:6).

Jesus received help to do His ministry (Luke 8:1-3). Jesus told the twelve (Matt. 10:5-15) and the seventy (Luke 10:4–5) to not bring money with them when they traveled. They were supposed to depend on other people to take care of them.
Yesu alipokea msaada wa kufanya huduma yake (Luka 8:1-3).Yesu aliwaambia wale kumi na mbili (Math 10:5-15) na wale sabini (Luka 10:4-5) kutokubeba pesa walipokuwa wanasafiri.Walitakiwa kutegemea kwa watu wengine kuwajali wao.

The early church fathers believed that it was good to help the prophets, as they say in Didache 13:1-7:
Wazee wa Kanisa la mwanzo waliamini kuwa ilikuwa vizuri kusaidia manabii, kama wanavyosema katika Didache 13:1-7:

> But every true prophet who wishes to settle among you is “worthy of his food.” Likewise a true teacher is himself worthy, like the workman, of his food. Therefore thou shalt take the firstfruit of the produce of the winepress and of the threshing-floor and of oxen and sheep, and shalt give them as the firstfruits to the prophets, for they are your high priests. But if you have not a prophet, give to the poor. If thou makest bread, take the firstfruits, and give it according to the commandment. Likewise when thou openest a jar of wine or oil, give the firstfruits to the prophets. Of money also and clothes, and of all your possessions, take the firstfruits, as it seem best to you, and give according to the commandment.
> <Lakini kila nabii wa kweli ambaye anataka kutulia kwenu ni “Zaidi ya chakula chake”.Vivyo hivyo mwalimu wa kweli ni wa thamani,kama mfanyakazi,wa chakula chake.Hivyo nawe utachukua tunda la kwanza la mazao ya zabibu na ya kupuria sakafu na ya ng’ombe dume na ya kondoo,naye atatoa kama tunda la kwanza kwa manabii,kwa kuwa ndio makuhani wako wakuu,wapatie maskini.Ukitengeneza mkate,chukua tunda la kwanza,na utoe kulingana na amri.Vivyo hivyo kama nawe ukifungua jagi la kinywaji cha zabibu au mafuta,toa tunda la kwanza kwa manabii.Ya pesa pia na mavazi nay a mali zako zote,chukua tunda la kwanza,kama inavyoonekana bora kwako, na utoe kulingana na amri.

### Paul chose not to use this right

### Paulo alichagua kutokutumia haki hii

After reading those Scriptures, it would seem that the answer is clear: "It is good to give to church workers." The problem is, we know from Scripture that just because something is good to do, doesn't mean that it is always best that we do that thing (1 Cor. 10:23).
Baada ya kusoma maandiko hayo,ingeweza kuonesha kuwa jibu ni sahihi:”ni vizuri kutoa watendakazi kwa kanisa”.Tatizo ni,tunajua kupitia andiko kuwa sio kwa kuwa tu kitu ni kizuri kukifanya,haimaanishi kuwa mara zote ni bora tukifanye kitu hicho(1 Kor 10:23).

Paul recognized that it was his right to receive for doing the work of the Gospel, but he chose not to use that right (1 Cor. 9:14-18. For more clarification, also read verses 6-13). In verse 14, he is referring to when Jesus sent out the 70 (Luke 10:1–7).
Paulo aligundua kuwa ilikuwa ni haki yake kupokea kwa ajili ya kufanya kazi ya injili,lakini alichagua kutokutumia haki hiyo (1 Kor 9:14-18.Kwa maelezo Zaidi pia soma mistari 6-13).Katika mstari wa 14,anarejelea wakati Yesu alipowatuma wale 70(Luka 10:1-7).

Why did Paul choose to not take money? He did not want to hinder the Gospel (1 Cor. 9:12). He thought that if he took money, then in the mind of some people, they would think he was only doing the ministry for the money. This would make the Gospel void (1 Corinthians 9:15).
Kwanini Paulo alichagua kutokuchukua pesa?Hakutaka kuizuia injili(1 Kor 9:12).Alifikiri kuwa angechukua pesa,basi katika akili za baadhi ya watu,wangefikiri kuwa alikuwa anafanya huduma kwaajili ya kupata pesa.Hii ingefanya injili kutokuwepo(1 Kor 9:15).

He also knew that some of the churches that he visited were poor, and he did not want to be a burden to them (2 Cor. 11:8-9; 1 Thess. 2:9–10).
Pia alijua kuwa baadhi ya makanisa ambayo aliyatembelea yalikuwa masikini,na hakutaka kuwa mzigo kwao(2 Kor 11:8-9; 1 Thes 2:9-10).

### Church leaders should be willing to work with their hands

### Viongozi wa kanisa wanatakiwa waifanye kazi kwa moyo wa kupenda kwa mikono yao

Paul could have taken money for himself, but instead he worked. Paul was a tent maker, and even when he was on his missionary trips, he could stop in one place and work to find money to live (Acts 18:1-4; 20:33-35). When he was in Thessalonica, he did not eat anyone's food without paying for it (2 Thess. 3:8). He hoped that by working, the people would see his example and stop being idle (2 Thess. 3:6–13).
Paulo angeweza kuchukua pesa kwaajili yake mwenyewe,lakini badala yake alifanya kazi.Paulo alikuwa mtengenezaji wa mahema,na hata alipokuwa katika ziara zake za kimisheni,angesimama katika eneo moja na kufanya kazi ilia pate pesa ya kuishi (Matendo 18:1-4;20:33-35).Alipokuwa Thesalonike,hakula chakula cha mtu yeyote bila kulipa (2 Thes 3:8).Alitumaini kuwa kwa kufanya kazi,watu wangetazama mfano wake na kuacha kukaa bure bila kazi(2 Thes 3:6-13).

Didache 12:1-5 says something similar to the teaching of Paul:
Didache 12:1-5 inasema kitu kinachofanana na mafundisho ya Paulo:

> Let everyone who “comes in the Name of the Lord” be received; but when you have tested him you shall know him, for you shall have understanding of true and false. If he who comes is a traveller, help him as much as you can, but he shall not remain with you more than two days, or, if need be, three. And if he wishes to settle among you and has a craft, let him work for his bread. But if he has no craft provide for him according to your understanding, so that no man shall live among you in idleness because he is a Christian. But if he will not do so, he is making traffic of Christ; beware of such.
> Na kila mmoja”anayekuja kwa jina la Bwana”apokelewe;lakini kama mmemjaribu mtamjua,kwa kuwa mtakuwa mnaelewa kweli na uongo.Kama ajaye ni msafiri,msaidieni kadri mwezavyo,lakini asibaki nanyi kwa Zaidi ya siku mbili,au,kama ikihitajika tatu.Na kama akitaka kuishi nanyi na kuwa na hila,muacheni afanye kazi kwaajili ya mkate wake.Lakini kama hana hila mpatieni kulingana na uelewa wenu,ili kwamba asiishi mtu miongoni mwenu akikaa bure bila kazi kwa kuwa ni mkristo.Lakini asipofanya hivyo atakuwa anatenda jambo lisilo halali kwa Kristo;jihadharini naye.
