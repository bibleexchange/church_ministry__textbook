Introduction: Leaders that are not like the world
Utangulizi : Viongozi ambao si kama ulimwengu

There is not a lot of information in the New Testament about the structure and function of the early church. Hakuna taarifa nyingi katika agano jipya kuhusu muundo na kazi za kanisa la kwanza. We cannot find an exact plan in the Bible about how we should run our churches. Hatuwezi kupata mpango halisi kwenye Biblia jinsi gani ya kuongoza makanisa yetu. Much of what we do in churches is from two thousand years of church history. Mambo mengi tufanyayo katika makanisa ni kutoka miaka elfu mbili ya historia ya kanisa.

Not everything we do in the church comes directly from the Bible. Siyo vyote vinavyofanyika katika kanisa hutoka kwenye Bibilia. That does not necessarily mean that these things are good or bad. Hilo halimaanishi kuwa vinavyofanyika kanisani ni vibaya au vizuri. We need to take what little we know from the Bible and compare it to our modern practices to see if we are following the principles laid out in the Bible. Tunatakiwa tuchukuwe kidogo tunachokijua kutoka kwenye Biblia na kulinganisha na mambo yetu ya kisasa kuona kama tunafuata kanuni zilizopo katika Bibilia.

We have to be careful that we do not copy the ideas of the world and use them in the church. Tunatakiwa kuwa makini sana tusiige mawazo ya dunia na kuyatumia kanisani. As Christians, we should not look to business leaders or politicians as examples of leadership, but church leaders will be different from the leaders of natural things. Kama Wakristo, hatupaswi kutazama viongozi wa biashara au wanasiasa kama mfano wa uongozi, lakini viongozi wa kanisa watakuwa tofauti na viongozi wengine wa vitu vya asili. What the world thinks of as a good leader is not what the Bible says is a good leader: Kile ambacho dunia hufikiri kuhusu kiongozi mzuri siyo kama Biblia inavyosema ni kiongozi mzuri.

There are also many things from our current church culture that does not come from biblical principles, but are things that were implemented by leaders who wanted to increase their power over others.Pia kuna mambo mengi kwenye tamaduni za kanisa la sasa ambayo siyo kutoka kanuni za kibiblia, ila ni mambo ambayo yaliwekwa na viongozi ambao walitaka kuongeza nguvu zao dhidi ya wengine. When we go into our study, we have to clear our minds of all the things that we think about leadership so that we can be ready to learn what the Bible really says about leadership. Tunapoingia kwenye mafunzo yetu, tunatakiwa kuondoa mawazo yote ya mambo tunayofikiri kuhusu uongozi ili kwamba tuwe tayari kujifunza kile Bibilia inasema kuhusu uongozi.

## The things that matter to us don't always matter to God

## Mambo ambayo ni muhimu kwetu kila mara hayana umuhimu kwa Mungu

### The number of people is not as important as spiritual growth

### Idadi ya watu siyo muhimu kama ukuaji wa kiroho

Matthew 7:13-14 makes it clear that there will not be many people who enter the kingdom of heaven. Mathayo 7:13-14 iko wazi kuwa hakutakuwa na wengi watakaoingia katika ufalme wa mbinguni. As a leader in the church, you should not be focusing on getting many people into the church, but you should focus that the people you do have under your authority grow up spiritually (Eph. 4:11-13). Kama kiongozi wa kanisa, usiweke nguvu kwenye kupata watu wengi kwenye kanisa, ila kuweka mkazo kwamba watu walio chini ya mamlaka yako wanakuwa kiroho . (Waefeso 4:11-13 ) Of course we can do outreach ministry to the lost, but what good is it if people come to church and remain spiritually immature? Tunaweza kufanya huduma nje kwa waliopotea ,lakini ni vizuri kweli watu waje kanisani na kubaki wachanga kiroho?

### Spiritual gifts are not as important as right relationship with God

### Karama za kiroho siyo muhimu kama mahusiano sahihi na Mungu

Some leaders look to have great power with God, but it is more important that we actually know who God is. Baadhi ya viongozi wanatazamia kuwa na nguvu kubwa na Mungu , lakini ni muhimu kweli kujua Mungu ni nani. Jesus said that in the last day, there will be people who will stand before the judgment and boast of all the miracles that they did. Yesu alisema kwenye siku ya mwisho , kuna watakao simama mbele ya hukumu na kujivunia miujiza waliofanya. God will tell them to go away because He never knew them (Matt. 7:21-23). Mungu atawaambia waondoke kwasababu kamwe hakuwajua Matayo 7:21-23.

## What is a leader?

## Kiongozi ni nini?

### A leader is servant of all

### Kiongozi ni mtumishi wa wote

In all four Gospels, Jesus tells his disciples that they are supposed to be servants:
Katika injili zote nne, Yesu anawaambia wanafunzi wake kwamba wanatakiwa kuwa watumishi:

Matthew 20:20-28- Mathayo 20:20-28 2. Mark 9:33-37; 10:35-45 - Marko 9:33-37;10:35-45 3. Luke 22:24-27- Luka 22:24-27 4. John 13:12-17- Yohana 13:12-17

We call leaders in the church "servants" of God, but many times they are not really serving, but instead being served. Tunawaita viongozi wa kanisa watumishi wa Mungu, lakini mara nyingi hawatumiki, , badala yake wanatumikiwa. As leaders, we should not look for special treatment in food, respect, or seating arrangement. Kama viongozi tusiangalie kupewa huduma maalumu kama chakula maalumu, heshima, au mpangilio wa ukaaji. When Jesus washed the feet of the disciples, that was the real work of a servant. Wakati Yesu alipowasafisha miguu wanafunzi, hiyo ilikuwa kweli kazi ya mtumishi. We need to be ready to sweep floors, wash dishes, or clean the toilets if we want to be leaders in the church. Tunatakiwa tuwe tayari kusafisha sakafu, kuosha vyombo, au kusafisha vyoo kama tunataka kuwa viongozi wa kanisa.

### A leader is to be a shepherd

### Kiongozi ni kuwa mchungaji

We are not here specifically talking about the position of pastor in the church, but all leaders in the church, no matter what their title is, is supposed to take care of the people in the church. Hatuko hapa mahususi kuzungumzia kuhusu nafasi ya Mchungaji kanisani,bali viongozi wote wa kanisa , bila kujali nafasi zao , ni kuhakikisha wanatunza watu wote ndani ya kanisa. We will talk more in the next chapter about the official title of pastor in the church . Tutazungumza Zaidi katika sura inayofuata kuhusu nafasi rasmi ya mchungaji katika kanisa.

A leader cares for the needs of others. Kiongozi hujali mahitaji ya wengine. The command is given two times in the New Testament for the leaders of the church to be shepherds of the flock of God (1 Peter 5:1-4; Acts 20:28). Amri imetolewa mara mbili katika agano jipya kwa viongozi wa kanisa kuwa wachungaji wa kundi la Mungu (1 Petro 5 :1-4; Matendo 20:28) Jesus also told Peter to feed His sheep (John 21:15). Yesu pia alimwambia Petro lisha kondoo zangu (Yohana 21:15 ) The shepherd is one who takes care of all needs of the sheep, including making sure they have food and water and protecting them (Psalm 23). Mchungaji ndiye anayeshughulika na mahitaji ya kondoo, pamoja na kuhakikisha wanapata chakula na maji na kuwalinda (Zaburi 23)

Jesus is our example as the good shepherd who lays down His life for the sheep (John 10:11). Yesu ni mfano wetu mzuri kama mchungaji mwema anayetoa maisha yake kwa ajili ya kondoo ( Yohana 10:11). Not everyone that is a leader in the church really cares for the people. Siyo kila mtu aliye kiongozi kanisani ambaye kweli anajali watu. Some will run away when things get difficult and leave the people to be scattered by the enemy (John 10:12-13). Wengine hukimbia wakati mambo yanapokuwa magumu na kuacha watu wakitawanywa na adui (Yohana 10:12-13)

#### The shepherd takes care of spiritual needs

#### Mchungaji hushughulika na mahitaji ya kiroho

The leaders in the church should make sure that the people understand the Word of God and pray for them when they have trouble in life.
Viongozi kanisani wanatakiwa kuhakikisha kuwa watu wanaelewa neno la Mungu na kuwaombea wakati wa matatizo ya maisha.

1. Jesus went to all the villages teaching and preaching- Yesu alienda katika vijiji vyote akifundisha na kuhubiri
2. Paul was a teacher (I Tim. 2:7; II Tim. 1:11)- Paulo alikuwa mwalimu 1 Timotheo 2:7 ; 2 Timotheo 1 :11)
3. The overseer is to be able to teach (I Tim. 3:2) Mwangalizi anatakiwa aweze kufundisha (1 Timotheo 3:2)n

#### The shepherd takes care of physical needs

#### Mchungaji hushughulikia mahitaji ya kimwili

In Acts chapter 6, there is a story about the apostles. Katika Matendo sura ya 6 . kuna habari kuhusu mitume. They were feeding the widows daily. Walikuwa wanawalisha wajane kila siku. They said they needed to find someone else to do that work, because when they were feeding people physical food, they were not able to have the time to minister in the Word of God (Acts 6:1-8).Walisema walihitaji kutafuta mtu mwingine kufanya hiyo kazi, kwa sababu wakati walipokuwa wanawalisha chakula cha kimwili, hawakuwa na muda wa kuhudumia neno (Matendo 6:1-6)

Caring for physical needs of people is a neglected aspect of Christian ministry, because like the apostles, we say we cannot leave the preaching of the Word to serve tables. Kuhudumia mahitaji ya kimwili ya watu ni dhana iliyopingwa na huduma ya Kikristo, kwasababu kama mitume, tunasema hatuwezi kuacha kuhubiri neno na kuhudumia meza. But they still made sure the people were fed, even though they did not do it themselves. Lakini bado walihakikisha watu wameshibishwa , pamoja na kwamba hawakufanya hivyo wenyewe. They found other leaders who could do that work.Walitafuta viongozi wengine ambao wangefanya hiyo kazi. As a church, we cannot separate the spiritual needs of the people from the physical needs. Kama kanisa, hatuwezi tenganisha mahitaji ya kiroho na mahitaji ya kimwili ya watu. There are many places in the New Testament that tell to care for the physical needs of people: Kuna maeneo mengi katika agano jipya ambayo husema kuhusu utunzaji wa mahitaji ya kimwili ya watu.

1. Jesus not only taught the people, but He also gave them physical food (Matthew 15:29-32). -Yesu Siyo tu kwamba aliwafundisha watu, bali aliwapa chakula cha kimwili pia (Mathayo 15:29-32)
2. Jesus will punish those who ignore the poor (Matthew 25:31-46) –Yesu ataadhibu wote wanaodharau maskini.
3. The deacons and overseers were to be "given to hospitality" (I Tim. 3:2; Titus 1:8) – Wazee na Maaskofu walipaswa “ kuwa na ukarimu” ( 1 Timotheo 3:2 ; Tito 1:8)
4. "Pure religion" is to help the widows and orphans (James 1:27)- “Dini ya kweli”ni inayosaidia wajane na yatima (Yakobo 1:27)
5. We cannot only pray for someone if they have a need, but we need to help them (James 2:15-17) – Hatupaswi tu kuomba kwa mtu mwenye uhitaji, bali tunatakiwa kuwasaidia (Yakobo 2:15-17.
6. The early church shared all their possessions, so no one had any needs (Acts 4:32-35)- Kanisa la mwanzo walishiriki pamoja vyote walivyokuwa navyo , hivyo hakukuwa na mhitaji (Matendo 4:32 -35)
7. We do not have the love of God if we ignore the poor (1 John 3:17-18) –Hatutakuwa na upendo wa Mungu kama tutawapuuza maskini (1 Yohana 3:17 -18)
8. We are to help people in the church and outside of the church (Rom. 12:13; Gal. 6:10; Philippians 2:4; 1 Tim. 5:8; 6:17-18; Heb. 13:16) – Tunatakiwa kuwasaidia watu ndani ya kanisa na nje ya kanisa . (Warumi 12:13; Wag 6:10; Wafilipi 2:4;1 Timotheo 5:8; 6:17-18; Waeb 13:16)

These commands for helping the poor are for everyone in the church and not only the leaders, but leaders need to be an example of these things. –Hii inaamrisha amri za kuwasaidia watu maskini ni kwa kila mtu kanisani siyo tu kwa viongozi, bali viongozi wanatakiwa kuwa mfano wa mambo haya.

### A leader is to be an example

### Kiongozi ni kuwa kielelezo

We cannot only tell others what to do, but we need to also do the things that we teach and preach. We should want other people imitate us and follow in what we do (Titus 2:7; Hebrews 13:7).- Hatuwezi tu kuwaambia watu nini cha kufanya, bali na sisi pia tunatakiwa kufanya mambo tunayofundisha na kuhubiri. Inatakiwa watu wengine watuige sisi na kutufuata katika kile tunachofanya . (Tito 2:7; Waebrania 13:7)

Timothy was young, so some people did not respect him. Paul told him to not let them stop them but to be an example of the faith (I Tim. 4:12).- Timotheo alikuwa mtoto, hivyo baadhi ya watu hawakumheshimu . Paulo alimwambia asiwaache kunyamaza ila awe mfano katika Imani (Timotheo 4:12)

We do not force people to do what is right, but we do what is right and others will see and follow (I Pet. 5:3). –Hatulazimishi watu kufanya kitu sahihi , bali tunafanya kilicho sahihi na wengine wataona na kufuata. (1 Petro 5:3)

Jesus condemned the religious leaders because they told the people to do one thing, but did something different (Matt. 23:2-3). Yesu aliwahukumu viongozi wakidini kwasababu waliwaambia watu wafanye kitu kimoja , na wao kufanya tofauti (Mathayo 23:2-3) Paul said something similar in Romans 2:21-23.- Paulo alisema jambo kama hilo katika Warumi 2:21 -23.

If we follow Jesus, when people follow us, they are really following Jesus (I Cor. 11:1). Kama tutamfuata Yesu, wakati watu wanatufuata sisi, watakuwa kweli wanamfuata Yesu (1 Wakor 11:1)

### A leader builds up

### Kiongozi hujenga

The reason that God gave ministers to the church was so that they could build up the church (Eph. 4:11-13). Sababu kwamba Mungu alitoa viongozi kwa kanisa ni ili walijenge kanisa (Waefeso 4:11- 13. This is not talking about building up a building, but about people growing spiritually until they become like Jesus.- Hii siyo kuhusu kujenga jengo , ila kuhusu kuwajenga watu kiroho mpaka wawe kama Yesu.

Every act of worship in the church should be to build up the people (I Cor. 14:26).- Kila tendo la kuabudu kanisani linapaswa liwajenge watu (1 Wakor 14:26)

The authority given to leaders is to be used to build up and not tear down (II Cor. 10:8; 13:10).- Mamlaka waliopewa viongozi ni kutumika kujenga na siyo kubomoa (11 Wakor 10:8;13:10)

All Christians should try to build each other up (Rom. 14:19; 15:2; I Thess. 5:11). – wakristo wote wanatakiwa kijaribu kujengana (Warumi 14:19; 15:2; 1 Wath 5:11 )
