# Symbols of the church

# Ishara za kanisa

Before we talk more about the leaders of the church, we need to make sure we understand what the church is. We do not have any place in the New Testament that explains exactly what the church is and how it is supposed to function day to day. What we do have are symbols that help us understand what the church is supposed to be. "What is immediately evident in these images for the church is that they all emphasize the communal aspect of Christian faith and life. This communal emphasis stands in contrast to the individualistic approach of so many of the expressions of Christianity in the modern Western world."
Kabla ya kuzungumza Zaidi kuhusu viongozi wa kanisa, tunatakiwa kuhakikisha tunaelewa kanisa ni nini. Hatukuwa na sehemu yeyote katika agano jipya inayoelezea hasa kanisa ni nini na linatakiwa kutendaje kazi siku kwa siku.Tulichonacho ni ishara zinazotusaidia kuelewa kanisa linatakiwa liweje.”Kilicho dhahiri cha haraka haraka katika picha za kanisa ni kwamba zote zinasisitiza kipengele cha jumuiya ya Imani ya kikristo na maisha. Msisitizo huu wa jumuiya unasimama kwa tofauti na mbinu ya kibinafsi ya maneno mengi ya kikristo katika dunia ya magharibi.”

## The body (1 Cor. 12:12-27; Rom. 12:4-5)

## Mwili ( 1 Kor 12:12-27;Rum 12:4-5

In the church, there is not one human leader who is more important than all other people in the church. The head of the body is not a human, but Jesus (Col. 1:18; Eph. 1:22-23; 5:23, 30). All members of the church, including pastors, bishops, and deacons, make up the body (Col. 1:24).
Katika kanisa, hakuna kiongozi wa kimwili ambaye ni muhimu kuliko watu wengine katika kanisa. Kichwa cha mwili sio mwanadamu, bali ni Yesu (Kol 1:18;Eph 1:22-23; 5:23,30).Washirika wote wa kanisa ukijumuisha wachungaji, maaskofu na mashemasi wanaunda mwili( Kol 1:24).

### We are members of the body of Christ

### Sisi ni washirika wa mwili wa Kristo

All members of the body are important (1 Cor. 12:21-25). We don't use every part of the body at all times, but through the day, every part of the body is used, even if we do not think about it.
Washirika wote wa mwili ni muhimu (1 Kor 12:21-25).Sio mara zote tunatumia kila sehemu ya mwili, lakini siku nzima, kila sehemu ya mwili inatumika, hata kama hatuifikirii.

1 Peter 2:9 teaches us that all believers are part of the priesthood of Christ. There are some people in the church who will have gifts for leading and administration, but that does not mean that they are more spiritual or essential to the church.
1 Petro 2:9 inatufundisha kuwa waamini wote ni sehemu ya ukuhani wa Kristo. Kuna baadhi ya watu ndani ya kanisa ambao watapata zawadi kwa ajili ya kuongoza na utawala, lakini hii haimaanishi kuwa wako kiroho sana au ni wa muhimu katika kanisa.

All members of the church should be closely joined together and work well together (Eph. 4:15-16).
Washirika wote katika kanisa wanatakiwa washikamane pamoja na kufanya kazi pamoja. (Efeso 4:15-16).

### Each member has a different work or gift

### Kila mshirika ana kazi tofauti au karama

Each member in the church has a different role to do that cannot be done by someone else, just as the hand cannot do the work of the foot, and nor can the foot do the work of the hand. We have two lists of gifts given in the New Testament:
Kila mshirika katika kanisa ana jukumu tofauti la kufanya ambalo haliwezi kufanywa na mtu mwingine yeyote, kama tu ambavyo mkono hauwezi kufanya kazi ya mguu,vivyo hivyo na mguu kufanya kazi ya mkono.Tuna orodha mbili za karama katika agano jipya:

We see that these lists have different gifts in them, but both have prophecy and teaching. We should not take these to be complete lists of gifts that God can give, but just some examples of gifts.
Tunaona kuwa orodha hizi zina karama tofauti ndani yake, lakini zote zina unabii na mafundisho. Hatutakiwa kuchukulia orodha hizi kama orodha pekee zilizotolewa na Mungu bali ni mifano tu ya karama.

#### Each member will have different gifts

#### Kila mshirika atakuwa na karama tofauti

1 Corinthians 12:29–30 makes it clear that some of these gifts will be given to someone, but not all of them. God will not give all the gifts of the spirit to one person, since that would mean that they would be proud and would not depend on other members of the church. Our limitations become our strengths when we learn to work together with people who have different strengths than we have.
1 Kor 12:29-30 inaweka sawa kuwa baadhi ya karama hizi zitatolewa kwa mtu, lakini sio zote. Mungu hatatoa karama zote kwa mtu mmoja, kwa kuwa hiyo itamaanisha watajivuna na hawatawategemea washirika wengine katika kanisa. Mipaka yetu inakuwa nguvu wakati tunajifunza kufanya kazi pamoja na watu wenye nguvu Zaidi ya tulizonazo.

#### An example of the gifts being used in the church

#### Mfano wa karama zinazotumika katika kanisa

An example of how these different gifts work in the church can be found in Acts 6:1-6. The apostles were feeding the widows every day, but they said that they had to stop, so that they could focus on prayer and ministry of the word. They chose seven men to do the work of feeding the widows. These men were "full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom." They were not less important than the apostles, but they had a different work to do.
Mfano wa namna karama hizi tofauti tofauti zinavyotenda kazi inaweza kupatikana katika Matendo 6:1-6.Mitume waliwalisha wajane kila siku, lakini walisema kuwa walitakiwa kuacha, ili kwamba waweze kuzingatia Zaidi maombi na huduma ya neno.Walichagua vijana saba kufanya kazi ya kuwalisha wajane. Vijana hawa walijaa “ Roho Mtakatifu na wajane:haimaanishi hawakuwa na umuhimu kuliko mitume bali walikuwa na kazi tofauti ya kufanya.

Later, Stephen "did great wonders and miracles among the people" (Acts 6:8) and was killed because he was preaching about Jesus. Philip went to Samaria and preached the Gospel, healed the sick, and cast out demons (Acts 8:5-13). Both of these men had great spiritual power, but were humble enough to serve tables.
Baadaye Stefano “alifanya maajabu na miujiza katikati ya watu”(Matendo 6:8) na aliuliwa kwasababu alikuwa anahubiri kuhusu Yesu. Philipo alikwenda Samaria na kuhubiri Injili, kuponya wagonjwa na kutoa mapepo (Matendo 8:5-13).Vijana wote hawa walikuwa na nguvu kuu ya rohoni lakini walikuwa wanyenyekevu hata kuhudumia meza.

## Temple/Building

## Hekalu/ Jengo

Even though many times we talk about the building as being the church, the church is people and not a building. We are the temple of the Holy Spirit. The church building is not the "house of God," but we are the house of God. Thus, a symbol of the church is that we are all bricks in a building:
Japokuwa mara nyingi tunazungumza kuhusu jengo kama kanisa, kanisa ni watu na sio jengo. Sisi ni hekalu la Roho Mtakatifu.Hivyo, ishara ya kanisa ni kuwa sisi ni matofali katika jengo:

Christ is the cornerstone (Matt. 21:42; Mark 12:10-11; Luke 20:17; Acts 4:11; Eph. 2:19-20; 1 Pet. 2:6-7).
Yesu ni jiwe la pembeni (Math 21:42;Marko 12:11;Luka 20:17;Matendo 4:11;Efe 2:19-20; 1Pet 2:6-7).

## Flock/Sheep (John 10:1-16, Acts 20:28-29, 1 Pet. 5:2-4)

## Kundi/Kondoo (Yohana 10:1-16,20:28-29, 1 Pet 5:2-4)

Jesus is the shepherd, and his people are the flock.
Yesu ni mchungaji, na watu wake ni kundi la kondoo.

## Family/Household

## Familia/Nyumba

- "The household of God, which is the church" (1 Tim. 3:15)
  -“ Nyumba ya Mungu,ambayo ni kanisa”( 1 Tim 3:15)

- Believers as "members of the household of God" (Eph. 2:19)
- Waamini kama “ washirika wa nyumba ya Mungu”( Efe 2:19)

## Branches (John 15:1-8)

## Matawi ( Yohana 15:1-8)

In Romans 11:17-24, Paul uses the metaphor of an olive tree to describe God's people.
Katika Warumi 11:17-24, Paulo anatumia mfano wa mti wa mzeituni kuwaelezea watu wa Mungu.

## Field/Harvest

## Shamba/Mavuno

The church is portrayed as God's field (1 Cor. 3:9) and workers in his harvest (Matt. 9:37-38).
Kanisa limeonyeshwa kama shamba la Mungu (1Kor 3:9)

## Bride of Christ (Eph. 5:25-32; Rev. 19:7-9, 21:2)

## Bibi harusi wa Kristo (Efe 5:25-32;Ufu 19:7-9,21:2)

Of all the symbols, this is the only one that is singular instead of being a composite or group.
Katika ishara zote, hii pekee ndiyo iko moja na sio katika kundi.
