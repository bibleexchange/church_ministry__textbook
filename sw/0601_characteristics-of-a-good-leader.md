# Characteristics of a good leader

#Sifa za kiongozi mzuri

We have lists of characteristics that are good for overseers (1 Tim. 3:1-7), deacons (1 Tim. 3:8-13), and elders (Titus 1:5-9). While these lists are good for us to understand what Paul was looking for in a good leader, we have to remember them in their original setting. These are letters written to specific people for a reason. In part, Paul was writing to Timothy and Titus to try to stop false teachers that were causing problems in the church (1 Tim. 1:6-7; Titus 1:10-11). These were things that were opposite of what the false teachers were doing. The following table shows how the qualities of the leaders in the church are opposites of what the false teachers were doing:<sup>[1]</sup>
Tuna orodha ya sifa ambazo ni nzuri kwa Waangalizi(1 Tim 3:1-7),Mashemasi(1 Tim 3:8-13),na wazee (Tito 1:5-9).Wakati orodha hizi ni nzuri kwetu kuelewa Paulo alikuwa anatazamia kwa kiongozi mzuri,tunatakiwa kuzikumbuka katika muundo wake halisi. Hizi ni barua zilizoandikwa kwa watu mahususi kwa sababu. Kwa sehemu, Paulo alikuwa anamwandikia Timotheo na Tito kujaribu kuzuia mafundisho potofu ambayo yalikuwa yanasababisha matatizo katika kanisa (1Tim 1:6-7;Tito 1:10-11).Hivi ni vitu ambavyo vilikuwa kinyume na kile walimu wa uongo walikuwa wanafanya:<sup>[1]</sup>

We should not think that these are complete lists of what makes a good leader. Nor should we think these are all absolutes, especially the requirements to be the husband of one wife or have a household to manage, since Paul himself was not married and thus did not have a household.
Hatutakiwi kufikiri kuwa hizi ni orodha kamilifu zinazomfanya kiongozi mzuri. Wala kufikiri kuwa hizi zote ni sahihi, hasa mahitaji ya kuwa mume wa mke mmoja au kuwa familia ya kuisimamia, kwa kuwa Paulo mwenyewe hakuoa na hata kuwa na familia.

Besides these longer lists in 1 Timothy and Titus, we have shorter lists that list qualities for leaders:
Zaidi ya hayo hizi orodha ndefu katika 1Timotheo na Tito, tuna orodha fupi ambazo zinaorodhesha sifa za viongozi:

The Didache had a similar list in 15:1-2:
Didache ina orodha inayofanana katika 15:1-2:

> Appoint therefore for yourselves bishops and deacons worthy of the Lord, meek men, and not lovers of money, and truthful and approved, for they also minister to you the ministry of the prophets and teachers. Therefore do not despise them, for they are your honorable men together with the prophets and teachers.<sup>[2]</sup>
> Jichagulieni kwaajili yenu maaskofu na mashemasi waaminifu kwa Bwana,watu wapole na wasiopenda fedha,watu wa kuaminiwa na waliothibitishwa kwani wanawahudumia ninyi pia huduma ya manabii na walimu. Hivyo msiwadharau kwa kuwa ni watu wenu wa muhimu pamoja na manabii na walimu.<sup>[2]</sup>

Polycarp had a similar lists in his epistle to the Ephesians:
Polikapi alikuwa na orodha inayofanana katika waraka wake kwa waefeso

> Likewise must the deacons be blameless before his righteousness, as the servants of God and Christ and not of man, not slanderers, not double tongued, not lovers of money, temperate in all things, compassionate, careful, walking according to the truth of the Lord, who was the "servant of all."
> Vivyo hivyo mashemasi wanatakiwa wawe watu wasio na hatia katika haki yake, kama watumishi wa Mungu na siyo wa mwanadamu, wasiohukumiwa, wasio na nia mbili, wasiopenda fedha, wenye kiasi kwa kila kitu,wenye huruma, waangalifu,wanaotembea sawasawa na kweli ya Bwana,ambaye alikuwa” mtumishi wa wote.”

> And let the presbyters also be compassionate, merciful to all, bringing back those that have wandered, caring for all the weak, neglecting neither widow, nor orphan nor poor, but "ever providing for that which is good before God and man," refraining from all wrath, respect of persons, unjust judgment, being far from all love of money, not quickly believing evil of any, not hasty in judgment, knowing that "we all owe the debt of sin."<sup>[3]</sup>
> Na wazee pia wawe na huruma,wenye huruma kwa wote,kuwarudisha wale waliopotea,kuwajali wadhaifu wote,kutokuwatenga wajane wala maskini,bali kutenda lile lililo jema kwa Mungu na wanadamu,”kuacha hasira,heshima kwa watu, hukumu zisizo za haki,kuwa mbali na kupenda fedha,kutokuwa wepesi kuamini uovu wowote, kutokuhukumu kwa haraka,tukijua kwamba wote tu wadeni wa dhambi.”<sup>[3]</sup>

We will not go over every item in these lists, but we will combine these lists together and highlight a few things that are repeated among them.
Hatutaangalia kila kipengele katika orodha hizi, bali tutachanga orodha hizi pamoja na kuonyesha vitu vichache ambavyo vimerudiwa kati yake.

## Character

## Tabia

All preachers can say they are called of God, but how do we know if they will really be a good leader in the church? We already said before that what makes a good leader in worldly things is not what will make a good leader in spiritual things.
Wahubiri wote wanaweza kusema waliitwa na Mungu,lakini tunawezaje kujua kama watakuwa viongozi wazuri katika kanisa?Tumeshasema mwanzo kuwa kinachomfanya kiongozi mzuri katika mambo ya dunia sicho kinachomfanya kiongozi mzuri katika kanisa.

We should not just look for someone who has a strong personality or is a "powerful" preacher. We need to look at how they live their lives. Jesus said we would know a tree by its fruit (Matt. 7:15-20). The only "ministry" ability in the lists in 1 Timothy and Titus is that the overseers and elders should be able to teach. That shows us that Paul considered character to be more important than the ability to speak.
Hatutakiwi tu kumuangalia mtu ambaye ana muonekano imara au “ni muhubiri mwenye nguvu.”Tunatakiwa kuangalia wanaishije maisha yao.Yesu alisema tutautambua mti kwa matunda yake (Math 7:15-20).”Huduma” pekee katika orodha katika 1Timotheo na Tito ni kwamba waangalizi na wazee wanatakiwa wawe na uwezo wa kufundisha. Hiyo inatuonyesha kwamba Paulo alichukulia tabia kuwa ya muhimu Zaidi kuliko uwezo wa kuongea.

These good characteristics are not things special for only leaders, but they are expected of all Christians. The leader is supposed to be an example of these characteristics. Sifa hizi nzuri sio tu vitu maalumu kwa viongozi pekee, bali zinatarajiwa kwa kila mkristo.

### Good reputation (1 Tim. 3:2, 7, 8; Titus 1:7)

### Sifa nzuri (1Tim 3:2,8;Tito 1:7)

All people inside and outside the church should know that the church leader is a good person:
Watu wote ndani na nje ya kanisa lazima wajue kuwa kiongozi ni mtu mzuri:

- They must be "above reproach" (1 Tim. 3:2)
  -Wanatakiwa kuwa watu wasiolaumika (1Tim 3:2)
- They must be "respectable" (1 Tim. 3:2)
  -Wanatakiwa kuwa “wakuheshimika”( 1Tim 3:2)
- They must "must have a good report of them which are without" (1 Tim. 3:7)
  -Ni lazima “washuhudiwe mema na watu walio nje”( 1Tim 3:7)
- They must be "worthy of respect" (1 Tim. 3:8)
  -Ni lazima”wastahili heshima”( 1Tim 3:8)
- They must be "be blameless" (Titus 1:7)
  -Ni lazima “wasiwe watu wa kulaumiwa”( 1Tito 1:7)

This was also listed as one of the requirements for the helpers in Acts chapter 6 (Acts 6:3).
Hii iliorodheshwa pia kama moja ya mahitaji kwa wasaidizi katika Matendo mlango wa 6 (Mdo. 6:3).

### Temperate (kiasi) (1 Tim. 3:2, 11)

### Kiasi ( 1Tim 3:2,11)

> The overseer is to maintain command of his reason, to be watchful and observant of things going on around him, and balanced in his assessments.<sup>[4]</sup>
> Kuwa mwangalizi ni kudumisha amri ya sababu yake. kuwa macho na kuyaangalia kwa umakini mambo yanayomzunguka,na kuweka uwiano katika tathmini yake.<sup>[4]</sup>

This was also supposed to be taught to the old men (Titus 2:2).
Hii ilitakiwa ifundishwe pia kwa wazee (Tito 2:2)

### Self control (1 Tim. 3:2; Titus 1:8)

### Kiasi ( 1Tim 3:2;Tito 1:8)

The term "self-control" "covers a range of meaning (prudence, moderation, sobriety), but gives the general sense of control over the behavior and the impulses and emotions beneath it."<sup>[5]</sup> Not everything is good for us. We need to learn to say "no" to the things that we want. When we come to Christ, we have to learn to deny ungodliness and worldly passions (Titus 2:11-12).
Neno” kiasi”linagusa maana mbalimbali(upole,kiasi,ukatili)lakini inatoa hisia za jumla za kiasi juu ya tabia na misukumo na hisia chini yake.”<sup>[5]</sup> sio kila kitu ni kizuri kwetu.Tunatakiwa tujifunze kusema “hapana”katika vitu tunavyovihitaji.Tunapokuja kwa Yesu, tunatakiwa tujifunze kukataa uasi na tamaa za kidunia( Tito 2:11-12).

This is for all believers and not just for leaders (1 Tim. 2:9, 15; Titus 2:2, 4, 5, 6).
Hii ni kwaajili ya waamini wote na sio tu viongozi( 1Tim 2:9,15;Tito 2:2,4,5,6).

### Not angry (1 Tim. 3:3; Titus 1:7)

### Asiwe mwepesi wa hasira( 1Tim 3:3;Tito 1:7)

- They must not be "a striker" (1 Tim. 3:3; Titus 1:7)
  -Asiwe “mgomvi”( 1Tim 3:3; Tito 1:7)
- They must not be "a brawler" (1 Tim. 3:3)
  -Si “mpiga watu”( 1Tim 3:3)
- They must not be "soon angry" (Titus 1:7)
- Wasiwe “wepesi wa hasira”( Tito 1:7)

### Not greedy for money (1 Tim. 3:8; Titus 1:7)

### Si walafi wa fedha ( 1Tim 3:8;Tito 1:7)

A leader in the church should not love money. We will talk more about leaders and money later.
Kiongozi katika kanisa asiwe mwenye kupenda fedha.Tutaongea Zaidi kuhusu viongozi na fedha baadaye.

### Must take good care of his family (1 Tim. 3:4, 12; Titus 1:6)

### Anatakiwa aitunze familia yake vizuri( 1Tim3:4;Tito 1:6)

The leader in the church must first be a good leader in the home. If he cannot take care of his family, how can he take care of the church?
Kiongozi katika kanisa lazima kwanza awe kiongozi mzuri katika familia yake. Kama hawezi kuitunza familia yake, atawezaje kulitunza kanisa?

### Hospitable (1 Tim. 3:2; Titus 1:8)

### Mkarimu ( 1Tim 3:2;Tito 1:8)

"Given the dangers of travel in the empire and the economic uncertainties faced by many believers, the early Christian mission and churches depended upon those who would open their homes and share their goods."<sup>[6]</sup> Jesus did not have His own house, but needed to stay in the house of other people. All Christians were supposed to be ready to receive the guest into their homes (Rom. 12:13; Heb. 13:2; 1 Pet. 4:9; 3 John 1:8).
Tunapewa hatari ya kusafiri katika himaya na kutokuwa na uhakika wa uchumi walioupitia waamini, huduma ya awali ya Kikristo na makanisa yalitegemea wale watakaofungua nyumba zao na kuwapokea wageni katika nyumba zao na kutoa vitu vyao,”<sup>[6]</sup> Yesu hakuwa na nyumba yake mwenyewe, bali alitaka kukaa katika nyumba za wengine.Wakristo wote walitakiwa kuwa tayari kupokea wageni katika nyumba zao (Rum 12:13;Waebrania 13:2; 1Pet 4:9; 3Yoh 1:8).

The Shepherd of Hermas, which was a document used for teaching in the early church, says:
Mchungaji wa Hermas, ambayo ilikuwa ni taarifa iliyotumika kwaajili ya mafundisho katika kanisa la kwanza, inasema:

> Bishops and hospitable men who at all times received the servants of God into their houses gladly and without hypocrisy; and the bishops ever ceaselessly sheltered the destitute and the widows by their ministration, and ever behaved with holiness.<sup>[7]</sup>
> Maaskofu na watu wakarimu ambao nyakati zote wanawapokea watumishi wa Mungu katika nyumba zao kwa furaha bila unafiki;na maaskofu ambao hawakuwahi kuchoka katika kuwapa hifadhi masikini na wajane katika hiduma zao, na ambao mara zote walitenda katika utakatifu.<sup>[7]</sup>

## Age

## Umri

1 Timothy 3:6 says that a bishop cannot be a novice, but those that mean they must be a certain age? Timothy was a young man and some people thought he should not be a leader. Paul told him to not let other people stop him because he was young (1 Tim. 4:12).
1 Timotheo 3:6 inasema kwamba Maaskofu hawawezi kuwa mtu aliyeokoka karibuni, bali wale ambao inamaanisha wanatakiwa kuwa na umri Fulani? Timotheo alikuwa kijana mdogo na baadhi ya watu walifikiri hatakiwi kuwa kiongozi. Paulo alimwambia asiruhusu watu wengine kumzuia kwa kuwa alikuwa mdogo (1 Tim 4:12).

This is talking about spiritual maturity, and not age. The overseer should not be a new Christian.
Hii inazungumzia ukuaji wa kiroho. Mwangalizi hatakiwi kuwa muongofu mpya.

The elders still have wisdom that comes from life, so we should learn from them (Titus 2:3-4) and
respect them (1 Pet. 5:5).
Viongozi bado wana hekima itokayo katika maisha, hivyo tunatakiwa kujifunza kutoka kwao (Tito 2:3-4) na tuwaheshimu ( 1 Tim 5:5)

## Marital status

## Hali ya ndoa

Does someone have to be married to be a leader in the church? Overseers (1 Tim. 3:2), deacons (1 Tim. 3:12), and elders (Titus 1:6) were all to be the husband of one wife. In Greek, there is no difference between the words "woman" and "wife." So in Greek, this prase is "one-woman man." There are four possible meanings to what Paul said.
Je ni lazima mtu awe ameoa au kuolewa ndio awe kiongozi ndani ya kanisa?Mwangalizi ( 1 Tim 3:2),Mashemasi ( 1Tim 3:12), na Viongozi ( Tito 1:6)naye ni mume wa mke mmoja. Kwa kigiriki, hakuna tofauti kati ya neno “ mwanamke” na “mke”. Hivyo kwa kigiriki hii tamaa ni mwanaume wa mwanamke mmoja.”kuna maana rahisi nne za nini Paulo alisema.

### Possible meaning 1: The Leader must be married

### Maana rahisi ya 1: Kiongozi lazima awe ameoa au kuolewa

This is not very likely, since Paul was not married (1 Cor. 7:8). He would not tell people to do something that he does not do himself. Other apostles had wives, and Paul had that right to take a wife. He chose not to take a wife so that he would have more freedom to travel and preach the gospel (1 Cor. 9:5).
Hii haiwezekani, kwa kuwa Paulo hakuoa ( 1 K0r 7:8).Asingeweza kuwaambia watu wafanye kitu ambacho yeye hakuweza kufanya. Mitume wengine walikuwa na wake, na Paulo alikuwa na hiyo haki ya kuoa. Alichagua kutokuoa ili awe na uhuru Zaidi kusafiri na kuhubiri injili( 1 Kor 9:5).

Paul thought it was good for people who were not married to not seek to get married (1 Cor. 7:25–28). This is because those that are not married only have to care about spiritual things, but those that are married have to care about both spiritual and natural things (1 Cor. 7:32-35). Even Jesus taught that some people choose not to marry for the kingdom of God (Matthew 19:9-12).
Paulo aliona kuwa ilikuwa vizuri kwa watu ambao hawajaoa kutokutafuta kuoa( 1 Kor 7:25-28).Hii ni kwasababu wale ambao hawajaoa watajali tu kuhusu mambo ya kiroho, lakini wale waliooa watatakiwa kujali kuhusu mambo ya kiroho na ya kimwili ( Math 19: 9-12).

Marriage is not a sin. It can even be a good thing. But it can limit your time, resources, and ability to move about.
Kuoa sio dhambi. Inaweza hata kuwa kitu kizuri. Lakini inaweza kuweka kikomo kwa muda wako,rasilimali, na uwezo wa kusonga mbele.

Marriage can help leaders, because they can learn to be a leader in their home and then be able to be a good leader in the church.
Kuoa kunaweza kusaidia viongozi,kwasababu wanaweza kujifunza kuwa viongozi katika nyumba zao na kuweza kuwa viongozi wazuri ndani ya kanisa.

### Possible meaning 2: The Leader must not have more than one wife at one time

### Maana rahisi ya 2: Kiongozi hatakiwi kuwa na Zaidi ya mke mmoja kwa mara moja

This is not likely what Paul meant, since not many Jews or Christians practiced polygamy.<sup>[8]</sup>
Hichi sicho hasa alichokimaanisha Paulo, kwa kuwa sio wayahudi wengi au wakristo walijihusisha na ndoa za mitara.<sup>[8]</sup>

### Possible meaning 3: The Leader must be faithful to his current wife

### Maana rahisi ya 3: Kiongozi lazima awe mwaminifu kwa mke wake

"This would allow for the possibility of an overseer being remarried after a death, divorce, or possibly adultery in the distant past but would disallow polygamy and sexual immorality (even if the overseer were not married, since the guidelines would be no less stringent for the unmarried than the married)."<sup>[9]</sup>
“Hii ingeruhusu uwezekano wa mwangalizi kuweza kuoa tena baada ya kifo, talaka au uzinzi lakini ingekataza ndoa za mitara na uasherati (hata kama maaskofu hawakuwa wameoa, kwa kuwa miongozo isingekuwa imewafunga wasiooa Zaidi ya waliooa.”<sup>[9]</sup>

### Possible meaning 4: The Leader must not marry again

### Maana rahisi ya 4:Kiongozi hatakiwi kuoa tena

In is possible that this means that the leader should not be divorced and married again.
Hii inamaaanisha kuwa kiongozi hatakiwi kuacha na kuoa tena.

In the second century, the church widely believed that this meant that the leader should not marry a second time, even if his first wife died.<sup>[10]</sup> They believed this because the leader was supposed to be a symbol of Christ marrying the church and Christ cannot marry a second church.
Katika karne ya pili, kanisa liliamini kwa upana kuwa kiongozi hatakiwi kuoa mara ya pili, hata kama mke wake amekufa.<sup>[10]<sup>waliamini hii kwasababu kiongozi alitakiwa kuwa kielelezo cha Yesu kulioa kanisa na Kristo hawezi kuoa kanisa lingine,

#### Conclusion to marriage status

#### Hitimisho la hali ya ndoa

Because of the difficult Greek language, it is difficult to know exactly which of these possibilities Paul intended. Without doubt, the passages are speaking of fidelity in marriage. That is, monogamous and acceptable in the eyes of the community.<sup>[11]</sup>
Kwasababu ya ugumu wa lugha ya kigiriki,ni ngumu kujua hasa ni nafasi zipi kati ya hizi Paulo alilenga. Bila shaka, nyaraka zinaongelea uaminifu katika ndoa.Hii ni, ndoa ya mke mmoja na inakubalika katika macho ya jamii.<sup>[11]<sup>

Paul included this in his list to show that it was good (although not necessary) for leaders in the church to be married. This is important, because the false teachers in Ephesus were forbidding people to be married (1 Tim. 4:3).
Paulo aliichanganya hii katika orodha yake kuonyesha kuwa ilikuwa nzuri (japo siyo lazima) kwa viongozi katika kanisa kuoa au kuolewa. Hii ni muhimu, kwasababu walimu wa uongo katika waefeso waliwazuia watu wasioe (1 Tim 4:3).

## Gender

## Jinsia

Does a church leader have to be a man?
Je ni lazima kiongozi wa kanisa awe mwanaume?

### In the Bible, there are many women who work for God

### katika Biblia, kuna wanawake wengi walitumika kwaajili ya Mungu

- Peter said daughters would prophesy
  -Petro alisema wana wa kike watatabiri

Besides these, Jesus had deep theological conversations with women, which shows that women were able to think about the things of God.
Mbali na hii,Yesu alikuwa na maongezi mazito ya kithiolojia na wanawake, hii inaonyesha kuwa wanawake waliweza kufikiri kuhusu mambo ya Mungu.

### Then why does Paul say not to let women teach in the church?

### Sasa kwanini Paulo alisema wanawake wasiruhusiwe kufundisha katika kanisa?

1 Timothy 2:11–12 and 1 Corinthians 14:34–35 are two Scriptures that seem to show that Paul does not let women speak in church.
1 Timotheo 2:11-12 na 1 Wakorintho 14:34-35 haya ni maandiko mawili ambayo yanaonekana kuonyesha kuwa Paulo hawaruhusu wanawake kuongea katika kanisa.

Some people think that because of these verses that women should not be allowed to be leaders in the church. Other people read about the women who work for God and believe that women can be leaders in the church. No matter what you decide, you have to find a way to reconcile these passages of Paul with the fact that so many women ministered in the early church.
Baadhi ya watu wanafikiri kwamba kwasababu ya mistari hii wanawake wasiruhusiwe kuwa viongozi katika kanisa.Watu wengine wanasoma kuhusu wanawake wanaofanya kazi ya Mungu na kufikiri kwamba wanawake wanaweza kuwa viongozi ndani ya kanisa.Bila kujali kile utakachoamua, unatakiwa kutafuta njia ya kutengeneza nyaraka hizi za Paulo na dhana kuwa wanawake wengi walihudumu katika kanisa la kwanza.

It is possible that Paul was dealing with specific issues of the churches he was writing to and not overall commands to the church at large.
Ni rahisi kuwa Paulo alikuwa anashughulika na mambo mahususi ya kanisa aliyokuwa anayaandikia na sio amri zote za kanisa kwa ukubwa.

### Possible explanations

### Maelezo yanayowezekana

These are some of the most difficult passages in the Bible and many intelligent scholars come to different answers on both sides.
Hizi ni baadhi ya nyaraka ngumu katika Biblia na wanafunzi werevu sana walikuja na majibu tofauti katika pande zote

#### These are commands for the whole church for all time and women should not be allowed to speak in the church

#### Hizi ni amri kwaajili ya kanisa zima kwa nyakati zote na wanawake wanatakiwa waruhusiwe kuongea katika kanisa

This is what many people believe. But it does not explain why there are so many women that worked for God in the New Testament.
Hii ndiyo watu wengi wanaamini. Lakini haielezei kwanini kuna wanawake wengi ambao walimtumikia Mungu katika agano jipya.

#### Paul was trying to fix specific problems with women in these churches (Corinth and Ephesus) and they are not universal prohibitions

#### Paulo alikuwa anajaribu kutatua matatizo mahususi na wanawake katika kanisa (Wakorintho na Waefeso)

For the passage in 1 Corinthians, we know Paul was writing to fix problems of disorder in the church. Earlier in the letter he writes to fix disorder about speaking in tongues and prophesying. (There Paul says that women can pray aloud and prophesy in the church. See 1 Cor. 11:5.) When he moves to talk about women, he is possibly trying to fix a problem of the specific women in Corinth causing disruption and not trying to teach something to all churches everywhere.
Kwa kifungu katika 1 Wakorintho,tunajua Paulo alikuwa anaandika kutatua matatizo ya wenye ulemavu ndani ya kanisa. Mwanzoni katika barua anaandika kutatua ulemavu wa kunena kwa lugha na kutabiri. (Pale Paulo anasema kuwa wanawake wanaweza kuomba kwa nguvu na kutabiri katika kanisa. Angalia 1 Kor 11:5.) Anapoendelea kuongea kuhusu wanawake, alikuwa anajaribu kutatua tatizo la mwanamke mahususi Korintho anayesababisha usumbufu na sio kujaribu kufundisha jambo kwa kanisa zima kila mahali.

As for 1 Timothy, there were women in the church in Ephesus that had turned away from the truth and were following false teachers (2 Tim. 3:6). It is possible that Paul was trying to stop these specific women from causing more division in the church.
Na kwa 1 Timotheo, kulikuwa na wanawake katika kanisa kule Efeso ambao waligeuka wakaiacha kweli na kufuata mafundisho ya uongo (2Tim 3:6), Ni rahisi kuwa Paulo alikuwa anajaribu kuzuia hawa wanawake mahususi waliokuwa wanasababisha matabaka ndani ya kanisa.

#### Paul was speaking in cultural contexts and was trying to adopt to them

#### Paulo alikuwa anaongea katika muktadha wa kitamaduni na alikuwa anajitahidi kuzishika

It is possible that the women in these churches were uneducated because they were not allowed to attend schools or the synagogue. Because they did not understand everything, they were asking their husbands questions and disrupting the church.
Ni rahisi kuwa wanawake katika haya makanisa walikuwa hawajasoma kwasababu hawakuruhusiwa kwenda shule au hata kwenye sinagogi. Kwasababu hawakuwa wameelewa kila kitu, walikuwa wanawauliza waume zao maswali na kuleta usumbufu katika kanisa.

1 Corinthians 14:34 says that the law says that women "are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission." There is no Law in the Old Testament that says anything like that. It is possible that "the law" was not Jewish, but Roman. If that is so, there here it should be translated "husband" and "wife" instead of "man" and "woman." There were Roman laws that did not let a wife correct her husband in public.
1 Wakorintho 14:34 inasema kwamba sheria inasema kwamba wanawake” hawaruhusiwi kuongea, lakini wawe katika kujitoa.”Hakuna sheria katika agano la kale inayosema kitu kama hicho. Inawezekana kuwa”sheria haikuwa ya kiyahudi lakini ya kirumi. Kama ndivyo ilivyo, inatakiwa itafsiriwe “mume” na “mke” badala ya “mwanaume” na “mwanamke”. Kulikuwa na sheria za kirumi ambazo hazikuruhusu mke kumsahihisha mume wake katika halaiki.

#### Paul was speaking of his own idea and not an idea directly from God

#### Paulo alikuwa anaongelea wazo lake mwenyewe na siyo wazo lililotoka kwa Mungu moja kwa moja

In 1 Timothy 1:12, Paul says that he himself does not let women speak. He does not say it is a commandment from God. This is not the only time Paul gives advice that is not directly a commandment from God (See 1 Cor. 7:25). But Paul in other places did work with women, so this explanation is unlikely.
Katika 1 Timotheo 1:12, Paulo anasema kwamba yeye mwenyewe haruhusu wanawake kuongea. Hajasema ni amri ya Mungu. Huu sio muda pekee ambao Paulo anatoa ushauri ambao sio amri ya Mungu moja kwa moja (angalia 1 Kor 7:25).Lakini katika maeneo mengine alifanya kazi na wanawake,hivyo maelezo haya hayawezekani.

### Conclusion on gender

### Hitimisho kuhusu jinsia

At the far ends of this debate are people who say women should do nothing at all in the church (such as the medieval church that banned congregational singing so that women would not sing) and those who see absolutely no difference between man and women in ministry. Most people fall somewhere between these two poles. Some say women cannot preach, but will let women sing and testify. Some believe women can be preachers, but not pastors or overseers.
Hitimisho la mjadala huu mrefu ni watu wanaosema wanawake hawafanyi chochote katika kanisa (ambao ni makanisa ya kati ambayo yalipiga marufuku uimbaji ili wanawake wasiimbe)na wale wanaoona kabisa kuwa hakuna tofauti kati ya wanaume na mwanamke katika huduma.Watu wengi wapo katika ncha hizi mbili. Baadhi wanasema wanawake hawawezi kuhubiri, lakini watawaruhusu wanawake kuimba na kushuhudia.Baadhi wanaamini wanaweza kuwa wahubiri lakini siyo wachungaji au waangalizi.
