# Delegation of authority and training others

# Mgawanyo wa mamlaka na kuwafundisha wengine

Some leaders are afraid of sharing the authority with others. They want to have all the power. But the church is a body and is is bigger than any one person. There is no way that one person can fulfill all the work of God.
Baadhi ya viongozi wanaogopa kushirikisha mamlaka kwa wengine.Wanataka kuwa na nguvu zote. Lakini kanisa ni mwili na ni kubwa kuliko mtu mmoja.Hakuna namna kwamba mtu mmoja anaweza kufanya kazi zote za Mungu.

We see in Exodus a story about Moses. Moses sat all day listening to the problems of the people and doing the work of a judge. He had a relative come to visit, and when the relative saw the work of Moses, he suggested that Moses share that work with others:
Tunaona katika Kutoka hadithi kuhusu Musa. Musa alitumia siku nzima kusikiliza matatizo ya watu na kufanya kazi kama hakimu. Alikuwa na ndugu aliyekuja kumtembelea na yule ndugu alipoona kazi ya Musa,alimshauri Musa ashirikishe kazi hiyo kwa wengine:

## Make disciples of all nations

## Wafanye mataifa kuwa wanafunzi

Before Jesus ascended to heaven, He gave a final commandment to His disciples. He told them to take the Gospel into all the world. The Greek that is used is best translated to "go into all the world and make disciples" (Matt. 28:18–20).
KablaYesu hajapaa mbinguni, Alitoa amri ya mwisho kwa wanafunzi wake. Aliwaambia wapeleke injili ulimwenguni pote. Maneno ya kigiriki yaliyotumika yametafsiriwa vizuri”Nenda ulimwenguni kote na kuwafanya wanafunzi”(Math 28:18-20).

It was always the plan of Jesus to teach disciples, who would then teach other disciples. This process of disciples making more disciples would continue until all the world had the opportunity to become disciples of Jesus. Paul told Timothy to teach people and give them authority to teach others (2 Tim. 2:2).
Ulikuwa ni mpango wa Yesu mara zote kuwafundisha wanafunzi,nani sasa atafundisha wanafunzi wengine. Muundo huu wa kuwafanya wanafunzi ungeweza kuendelea mpaka dunia nzima ipate nafasi ya kuwa wanafunzi wa Yesu. Paulo alimwambia Timotheo awafundishe watu na kuwapa mamlaka ya kuwafundisha wengine (2Tim2:2).

### Jesus and the twelve

### Yesu na wale kumi na mbili

Jesus spent a lot of time teaching the twelve disciples. He took every opportunity that He could to teach them. He taught them while they were walking down the road, when they were in the boat, and when they were sitting at the table to eat food.
Yesu alitumia muda mwingi kuwafundisha wanafunzi kumi na mbili. Alitumia kila nafasi aliyoipata kuwafundisha. Aliwafundisha walipokuwa wanatembea barabarani, walipokuwa kwenye boti,na wakati walipokuwa wamekaa mezani kula chakula.

He made sure that they were ready to continue His ministry. He sent them out to preach and gave them power to heal sicknesses and cast out demons (Matt. 10:1; Mark 3:13-15).
Alihakikisha kuwa walikuwa tayari kuendeleza huduma yake. Aliwatuma nje kuhubiri na kuwapa nguvu ya kuponya wagonjwa na kutoa mapepo (Math 10:1;Marko 3:13-15).

### Jesus and the seventy

### Yesu na wale sabini

It was not only the twelve that Jesus prepared for ministry, but in Luke 10:1-9, Jesus sent out seventy people to go before Him to the villages to preach and heal people. This was to prepare the people to be ready to hear the message of Jesus. He gave them complete authority to speak on His behalf (Luke 10:16).
Sio tu wale kumi na mbili ndo ambao Yesu aliwaandaa kwaajili ya huduma,lakini Luka 10:1-9,Yesu aliwatuma nje wale sabini kwenda vijijini kuhubiri na kuponya watu. Hii ilikuwa ni kuwaandaa watu kuwa tayari kusikiliza ujumbe wa Yesu. Aliwapatia mamlaka kamili kuongea kwa niaba yake (Luka 10:16).

### Elders and the younger

### Wazee na wadogo

Those that are elders in the church should train those that are younger (Titus 2:3–4).
Wale walio wazee katika kanisa wanatakiwa wawafundishe wale wadogo (Tito 2:3-4).

Paul trained Timothy in spiritual things. He became a spiritual father to him. He gave Timothy authority to continue the work that he started.
Paulo alimfundisha Timotheo katika mambo ya kiroho. Alikuwa baba yake wa kiroho. Alimpatia Timotheo mamlaka kuendeleza kazi aliyoianza.

1. Paul took Timothy to work with him in ministry (Phil. 2:22)
   1.Paulo alimchukua Timotheo kufanya naye kazi katika huduma (Phil 2:22)
2. Paul sent Timothy to continue his work (1Cor. 4:17; 16:10-11)
   2.Paulo alimtuma Timotheo kuendeleza kazi yake (1Kor 4:17;16:10-11)
3. Paul called Timothy his coworker (1 Thess. 3:2-3)
   3.Paulo alimuita Timotheo
4. Paul left Timothy in Ephesus to try to stop the false teachers (1 Tim. 1:3-4)
5. Paulo alimuacha Timotheo Efeso kujaribu kuzua mafundisho(1Tim 1:3-4)
6. Paul encouraged Timothy to continue in the work and to not be afraid or let other people stop him (1 Tim. 4:12-14; 2 Tim. 1:6-7; 2:1-2; 3:14-15)
   5.Paulo alimtia moyo Timotheo kuendelea katika kazi na kutokuogopa au kuruhusu watu kuwazuiz(1Tim4:12-14;2Tim 1:6-7;2:1-2;3:14-15)

## Appointing church leaders

## Kuteua viongozi wa kanisa

It is true that it is God who calls people to ministry and gives them spiritual gifts to do that work, but it helps the church when we officially recognize leaders as being sent by God.
Ni kweli kuwa ni Mungu ndiye anayeita watu kwaajili ya huduma na kuwapa karama za rohoni kufanya hiyo kazi,lakini inasaidia kanisa tunapogundua rasmi kuwa viongozi wametumwa na Mungu.

Paul appointed leaders in the churches as he traveled (Acts 14:23)
1.Paulo aliwateua viongozi katika kanisa aliposafiri(Matendo 14:23) 2. Paul left Titus in Crete so that he could appoint elders in the churches (Titus 1:5)
2.Paulo alimuacha Tito kule Krete ili kwamba awateue wazee katika kanisa (Tito 1:5)

### We see sometimes when this appointment was made by the group of elders

### Tunaona mara nyingine uteuzi huu unafanywa na kikundi cha wazee

This was not just the decision of one leader to choose other leaders, but all the leaders in a church were to be in agreement:
Hii haikuwa tu maamuzi ya kiongozi mmoja kuchagua viongozi wengine, lakini viongozi wote katika kanisa walitakiwa kuwa katika makubaliano:

Timothy received his gift when the elders laid hands on him (1 Tim. 4:14 )

1. Timotheo alipokea karama yake wakati wazee walipomuwekea mikono (1 Tim 4:14)
2. Paul was sent on his first missionary trip after the elders in Antioch laid hands on him and prayed for him (Acts 13:1-3)
   2.Paulo alitumwa katika safari yake ya kwanza ya kihuduma baada ya wazee kule Antiokia walimuwekea mikono na kumuombea (Matendo 13:1-3)

### People should be tested before being made leaders

### Watu ni lazima wapimwe kabla ya kufanywa viongozi

We should not be quick to choose leaders in the church (1 Tim. 5:22), but we should test them to make sure that they will be good leaders (1 Tim. 3:10).
Hatutakiwi kufanya haraka kuchagua viongozi kanisani (1Tim 5:22), lakini tunatakiwa tuwapime ili kuwa na uhakika kuwa watakuwa viongozi wazuri (1Tim 3:10).

This is why Paul gave lists for the qualification of leaders in 1 Timothy chapter three and Titus chapter one.
Hii ndiyo sababu Paulo aliwapa orodha ya sifa za viongozi katika 1Timotheo mlango wa tatu na Tito mlango wa kwanza.

## Sending by the church

## Kutumwa na kanisa

Sometimes the church would chose to send someone to do a specific task.
Wakati mwingine kanisa linaweza kuchagua kumtuma mtu kufanya jukumu mahususi.

Judas and Silas were sent with a letter from the elders (Acts 15:22-27). After reading the letter, Judas and Silas exhorted more about what the meaning of the letter was (Acts 15:32).

1. Yuda na Sila walitumwa na barua kutoka kwa wazee (Matendo 15:22-27).Baada ya kusoma barua,Yuda na Sila waliwausia sana kuhusu barua ilimaanisha nini(Matendo 15:32)
2. Titus and an unnamed brother were sent by the church to bring the collection to Jerusalem (2 Cor. 8:16-19).
   2.Tito na ndugu ambaye hakutajwa jina walitumwa na kanisa kuleta matoleo Yerusalemu (2 Kor 8:16-19).
3. The Philippian church sent Epaphroditus to help Paul (Philippians 2:25).
4. Kanisa la Filipi lilimtuma Epafrodito kumsaidia Paulo (Filipi 2:25).
5. The church in Jerusalem sent Peter and John to Samaria to help Philip (Acts 8:14).
   4.Kanisa kule Yerusalemu lilimtuma Petro na Yohana Samaria kumsaidia Filipo (Matendo 8:14).
6. The church in Jerusalem sent Barnabas to Antioch to evangelize (Acts 11:22).
   Kanisa la Yerusalemu lilimtuma Barnaba kule Antiokia kufanya uinjilisti (Mdo 11:22).

## The process of some people being chosen as leaders

## Mchakato wa baadhi ya watu kuchaguliwa kama viongozi

### The disciples

### Wanafunzi

Jesus called most of His disciples in a similar way. They were doing their normal work, Jesus came by and simply called for them to follow, and they left what they were doing to follow Him.
Yesu aliwaita wanafunzi wake wengi kwa njia inayofanana.Walikuwa wanafanya kazi zao za kawaida,Yesu alikuja kwao na kirahisi akawaita wamfuate,na waliacha walichokuwa wanafanya wakamfuata.

Peter and Andrew (Matt. 4:18-20)

1. Petro na Andrea (Math 4:18-20)
2. James and John the sons of Zebedee (Matt. 4:21-22)
3. Yakobo na Yohana mwana wa Zebedayo (Math 4:21-22)
4. Philip (John 1:43-44)
5. Filipo (Yohana 1:43-44)
6. Nathanael, also known as Bartholomew (John 1:45-49)
7. Nathanaaeli, pia aliyeitwa Batholomayo (Yohana 1:45-49)
8. Matthew, also known as Levi (Matt. 9:9; Mark 2:14)
9. Mathayo, pia aliyeitwa Levi (Math 9:9;Marko 2:14)
10. Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, Judas son of James, also known as Thaddaeus. We have no record of them being called, but we wee them listed among the other disciples in Luke 6:12-16.
    Tomaso,Yakobo mwana wa Alfayo, Simoni aitwaye Zelote,Yuda mwana wa Yakobo, pia aliitwa Tadei. Hatuna rekodi ya wao kuwa waliitwa, lakini tunawaona wakiwa wameorodheshwa kati ya wanafunzi wengine katika Luka 6:12-16.
11. Judas Iscariot. We do not have record of how he was called, but Jesus says that he was called (John 6:70-71).
    7.Yuda Iskariote. Hatukuwa na rekodi ya namna alivyoitwa, lakini Yesu anasema kuwa aliitwa (Yohana 6:70-71).

### Mathias (Acts 1:23–26)

### Mathiya (Matendo 1:23-26)

The apostles wanted to chose someone to take the place of Judas Iscariot after he killed himself. There were two men that they thought would be good to replace Judas: Joseph or Matthias. But how would they choose which one? First, they prayed to God to show them. That is not surprising. What is surprising is that they next write the names of the two men on paper and randomly choose one. They believed that it was not really random, but that God would guide their hand to make the correct choice. This is the only time in the New Testament where we see a leader chosen in this way, but this process was used other times in the Old testament to make decisions.
Mitume walitaka kuchagua mtu wa kuchukua nafasi ya Yuda Iskariote baada ya kujiua. Kulikuwa na vijana wawili ambao walifikiri wangekuwa wazuri wa kuchukua nafasi ya Yuda:Yusufu au Mathiya. Lakini watajuaje ni yupi?Kwanza,walimwomba Mungu awaonyeshe. Hiyo haikushangaza. Waliamini kuwa haikuwa tu kiholela, lakini kwamba Mungu angeongoza mikono yao kufanya maamuzi sahihi.Huu ndio wakati wa pekee katika agano jipya ambao tunaona kiongozi akichaguliwa katika njia hii, lakini mchakato huu ulitumika muda mwingine katika agano la kale kufanya maamuzi.

### Helpers that feed the widows (Acts 6:1-6)

### Wasaidizi waliowalisha wajane (Matendo 6:1-6)

The Apostles wanted to find seven leaders to help serve food to the widows. They chose men who were honest, full of the Holy Spirit, and full of wisdom. After they chose the men, they prayed and laid their hands on them.
Mitume walitaka kutafuta viongozi saba kusaidia kugawa chakula kwa wajane.Walichagua vijana ambao walikuwa waaminifu,waliojaa Roho Mtakatifu,na waliojaa hekima.Baada ya kuwachagua hawa vijana,waliwaombea na kuwawekea mikono.
