# The social setting of the early churches

# Uwekaji wa makanisa kijamii ya mwanzo

## Location

## Eneo

Immediately after the Day of Pentecost, we see the church started the practice of meeting every day in the house of one of its members and having a meal. Every day they would do this in someone else's house (Acts 2:46; 5:42). This practice of meeting in houses continued through all the New Testament. When Paul was in Ephesus, he acknowledged that the main way that the church spread doctrine was "from house to house" (Acts 20:20). Following is a list of people who had churches in their houses:
Mara tu baada ya siku ya pentekoste, tunaona kanisa lilianza kukutana kila siku katika nyumba ya mmojawapo wa washirika na kula pamoja. Kila siku walifanya hivi katika nyumba ya mmoja wa washirika wao (Matendo 2:46;5:42).Utendaji huu wa kukutana katika nyumba uliendelea hata mapaka agano jipya. Wakati Paulo alipokuwa Efeso,aligundua kuwa njia kuu ambayo kanisa lilieneza mafundisho ni katika “nyumba kwa nyumba” (Matendo 20:20). Ifuatayo ni orodha ya watu ambao walikuwa na makanisa katika nyumba zao:

Aquila and Priscilla (1 Cor. 16:19; Rom. 16:3-5)

1.  Akila na Priska (1Kor 16:19;Warumi 16:3-5)
2.  Nympha (Col. 4:15)
    2.Nimfa(Kol 4:15)
3.  Philemon (Philemon 1:1-2)
    3.Filemoni (Filemoni 1:1-2)
4.  Lydia (Acts 16:40)
    4.Lidia (Matendo 16:40)
5.  Possibly Gaius (Rom. 16:23)
    5.Labda Gayo (Rum 16:23)

### Household codes

### Alama za kifamilia

Because the early church met in houses, there are several times in the epistles that we see lists of rules for each person in the family (Eph. 5:21-6:9; Col. 3:18-4; 1 Pet. 2:18-3:7). These were called "household codes" and they were a common thing in the Roman world.
Kwakuwa makanisa ya kwanza yalikutana nyumbani, kuna nyakati kadhaa ambazo katika maandiko tunaona orodha ya sheria kwaajili ya kila mtu katika familia (Efe 5:21-6:9; Kol 3:18-4;1Pet 2:18-3:7). Hizi zilikuwa zinaitwa “alama za kifamilia”na zilikuwa ni kitu cha kawaida katika dunia ya kirumi.

1 Timothy 5:1-2 tels us that we are to treat the people in the church as family members (See also Gal. 6:10; Heb. 13:1; 1 Pet. 2:17; 1 John 3:16).
1 Timotheo 5:1-2 inatuambia kuwa tunatakiwa tuwachukulie watu katika kanisa kama mwanafamilia (Agalia pia Gal 6:10;Ebr 13:1;1 Pet 2:17;1 Yohana 3:16).

### The church is people

### Kanisa ni watu

The word church is never used in the New Testament to refer to a building, but it always refers to a group of people. We are the temple of the Holy Ghost (1 Cor. 6:19). We are the House of God, and not any building.
Neno kanisa halijawahi kutumika katika agano jipya likimaanisha jengo, bali mara zote lilirejelea kundi la watu. Sisi ni hekali la Roho Mtakatifu (1 Kor 6:19). Sisi ni nyumba ya Mungu, na sio jengo lolote.

## Transition from Synagogues

## Mpito kutoka katika masinagogi

We must remember that the church at first did not think of itself as a new religion, but as a continuation of the Jewish religion. Many times in the New Testament, the teachings of Christ started in the Jewish synagogues. Jesus himself taught in synagogues (Luke 4:15-16; Matt. 4:23) and so did Paul immediately after he became a Christian (Acts 9:20) and on his missionary journeys to Antioch of Pisidia (Acts 13:14-16), Iconium (Acts 14:1), Thessalonica (Acts 17:1-2), and Corinth (Acts 18:4).
Tunatakiwa kukumbuka kuwa kanisa mwanzo halikujifikiria lenyewe kama dini mpya, bali kama mwendelezo wa dini ya kiyahudi. Mara nyingi katika agano jipya, mafundisho ya Yesu yalianzia katika masinagogi ya kiyahudi. Yesu mwenyewe alifundisha katika masinagogi (Luka 4:15-16;Math 4:23) na hivyo hivyo Paulo mara tu baaada ya kuwa mkristo (Matendo17:1-2),na Wakorintho (Matendo 18:4).

James refers to the Christian assembly as a "synagogue" (James 2:2).
Yakobo anarejelea katika mkutano wa wakristo kama “sinagogi”(Yakobo 2:2).

### Jewish Synagogue worship

### Sinagogi la kiyahudi la kuabudia

We are not exactly sure what exactly happened in the synagogue as part of regular worship, there are some things we know from reading the New Testament:
Hatuna uhakika kamili kwamba nini hasa kilitokea katika sinagogi kama sehemu ya ibada ya kawaida, kuna baadhi ya vitu tunavyovijua kutokana na kusoma agano jipya:

A central element was reading of Scripture (Luke 4:16-20; Acts 13:15; 15:21).

1.  Kipengele cha kati kilikuwa kusoma andiko (Luka 4:16-20;Matendo 13:15;15:21).
2.  After readings, there was often teaching and interpretation of the Scripture (Luke 4:20-27; Acts 13:15-16).
    2.Baada ya kusoma, mara nyingi kulikuwa na mafundisho na tafsiri ya andiko (Luka 4:20-27;Matendo 13:15-16).
3.  There was prayer (Matt. 6:5; Mark 12:40).
4.  Kulikuwa na maombi (Math 12:40).
5.  There were special seating arrangements for wealthy and important people (Matt. 23:6; James 2:2-3).
6.  Kulikuwa na mpangilio wa kukaa wa matajiri na watu muhimu (Math 23:6;Yakobo 2:2-3).
7.  There were leaders in the synagogue, though we do not know exactly what their duties were (Luke 8:41; Mark 5:22; Acts 13:15).
    Kulikuwa na viongozi katika sinagogi, japokuwa hatujui hasa majukumu yao yalikuwa ni yapi (Luka 8:41;Marko 5:22;Matendo 13:15).
8.  Synagogue worship took place primarily on the Sabbath (Luke 4:16; Acts 13:14; 17:2).
9.  Kimsingi ibada katika sinagogi zilifanyika katika sabato (Luka 4:16;Matendo 13:14;17:2).

### Christian adoption of Jewish worship

### Kuathiriwa kwa wakristo na ibada ya kiyahudi

As we have said before, we do not know what worship in the early church was exactly like, either. We can assume that the early Christians that were Jewish brought some of their customs and ways of worship with them when they started forming their own places of worship. We see some ways how the early church continued in Jewish worship:
Kama tulivyosema, hatukujui kuabudu kulimaanisha nini hasa, labda.Tunaweza kuhisi kuwa wakristo wa kwanza ambao walikuwa wayahudi walileta baadhi ya mila na njia za kuabudu wakati walipoanza kuunda maeneo yao ya kuabudu.Tunaona baadhi ya njia za namna kanisa la kwanza la kiyahudi lilivyoabudu:

The church of Jerusalem met every day in the temple courts (Acts 2:46)

1.  Kanisa la Yerusalemu lilikutana kila siku katika hekalu (Matendo 2:46)
2.  Peter and John went to the temple to pray (Acts 3:1)
3.  Petro na Yohana walienda hekaluni kuomba (Matendo 3:1)
4.  Paul participated in the temple purification (Acts 21:26)
    3.Paulo alihusika katika utakaso wa hekalu (Matendo 21:26)
5.  Paul still celebrated the Jewish festivals (Acts 20:6, 16)
6.  Paulo alisherekea sherehe za kiyahudi (Matendo 20:6,16)
7.  Some Christians still worshipped on the Sabbath (Acts 20:7)
8.  Baadhi ya wakristo bado waliendelea kuabudu katika sabato (Matendo 20:7)

As time continued and more people that were not Jewish became a part of the church, the church slowly observed fewer of the Jewish practices.
Muda ulivyoendelea na watu wengi ambao hawakuwa wayahudi waliingia na kuwa sehemu ya kanisa, kidogokidogo kanisa lilianza kupunguza kutenda matendo ya kiyahudi.

## The meaning of the word "church"

## Maana ya neno “Kanisa”

The Greek word for _church_ is "Ekklesia." It means "those called out." As with many words used by the church in the New Testament, it was not original to the church, but had a meaning in natural life. The Ekklesia was a word used in civic government for city councils.
Neno la kigiriki kuhusu kanisa ni “Ekklesia”. Ina maana “wale walioitwa”.Kama maneno mengi yaliyotumika katika agano jipya, haikuwa halisi kwa kanisa, bali yalikuwa na maana katika maisha ya asili. Ekklesia lilikuwa neno lililotumika katika serikali za kiraia za mabaraza ya jiji.

The same word is used for the church in a single house, all the house churches in a city, and the universal church. When we talk of the "church in Jerusalem" it was not one group of people, but several house churches who probably had some form of fellowship. Because there would be several house churches in one city, that is why the terms for leadership are usually plural (1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 4:11; 1 Thess. 5:12, 13; Heb. 13:7, 17; James 5:14).<sup>[1]</sup> There would be some leaders in each house church.
Neno hilo hilo lilitumika kwa kanisa katika nyumba moja, makanisa yote ya nyumbani katika jiji, na kanisa la kati. Tukizungumzia kanisa la “kanisa la Yerusalemu” haikuwa kundi moja la watu, bali makanisa kadhaa ya nyumbani, ambayo labda yalikuwa na baadhi ya muundo wa ushirika. Kwasababu kungekuwa na makanisa ya nyumbani kadhaa katika mji, ndio maana maneno ya uongozi mara zote ni nyingi (1 Kor 12:28;Efe 4:11;1 Thes 5:12;Ebr 13:7,17;Yakobo 5:14).<sup>[1]</sup>kungekuwa na baadhi ya viongozi katika kila kanisa la nyumbani.

### The universal church

### Kanisa zima

Ephesians 4:4 says that "there is one body," referring to the church. We know that this is true in a spiritual sense. God only has one church. But in a natural sense, there was probably never a time when there was a completely united group of people called the church. Paul writes most of his letters to combat false teaching or heal divisions in the church, so we see that even in the very beginning, there were divisions and corruptions in the church.
Waefeso 4:4 inasema kuwa “kuna mwili mmoja”, linalorejelea kanisa.Tunajua kuwa hiyo ni sahihi katika muktadha wa kiroho. Mungu ana kanisa moja. Lakini katika muktadha wa kiasili, hakukuwa na labda wakati ambao kulikuwa na kundi kamili lililoungana la watu lililoitwa kanisa. Paulo anaandika barua zake nyingi kupambana na mafundisho hasi au kuponya migawanyo katika kanisa, hivyo tunaona kuwa hata mwanzoni kulikuwa na migawanyo na rushwa katika kanisa.

The elders and apostles wrote a letter in Acts 15 and sent it out to the churches, but who enforced it? They had no way to go to every place and make sure people followed their rules. We see that Paul later did not completely follow it or endorse it, since he taught that eating meat sacrificed to idols was not an issue.
Wazee na Mitume waliandika barua katika Matendo 15 na kuzituma nje kwa makanisa, lakini nani alitekeleza? Hawakuwa na namna bali kwenda kila mahali na kuhakikisha kuwa watu wanazifuata sheria zao.Tunaona kuwa baadaye Paulo hakufuata au kuidhinisha,kwa kuwa alifundisha kuwa kula nyama,kuabudu sanamu hakukuwa na shida.
