# Our response to leadership

# Itikio letu juu ya uongozi

## Leaders are established by God

## Viongozi wanaanzishwa na Mungu

Daniel 2:21 teaches that God is the one who establishes government leaders in this world. There is no authority, unless it comes from God (Rom. 13:1-2). God is the one who has given leaders to the church to help us grow in Christ (Eph. 4:11).
Daniel 2:21 inafundisha kwamba Mungu ndiye anayeanzisha viongozi wa serikali katika dunia hii.Hakuna mamlaka isipokuwa inatoka kwa Mungu (Rum 13:1-2).Mungu ndiye anayewatoa viongozi wa kanisa kutusaidia kukua katika Kristo (Eph 4:11).

## Do not blindly follow all leaders

## Usiwe kipofu na kufuata viongozi wote

We should not automatically follow every leader in the church. They are human, as we are, and so can make mistakes, be deceived, or sin. We need to be careful that we are not like blind men being lead by other blind men (Matt. 15:14). We need to examine the lives and teaching of leaders to see if they are worthy of following.
Hatutakiwi tu moja kwa moja kumfuata kila kiongozi ndani ya kanisa.Ni wanadamu kama tulivyo sisi na hivyo wanaweza kufanya makosa pia,kudanganywa au dhambi.Tunatakiwa kuwa makini kwamba hatuko kama watu vipofu kuongozwa na vipofu wengine (Math 15:14).Tunatakiwa kujichunguza maisha yetu na mafundisho ya viongozi kuona kama zinzstahili kufuatwa.

The Jews in Berea did not at first believe everything that Paul said, but they went home and searched the Old Testament to see if the things he said were true (Acts 17:11). Because there are many false prophets in the world, we need to test the spirits (1 John 4:1). Jesus said that they way we will know if someone is a true prophet is by their fruit (Matt. 7:15-16).
Hata wayahudi kule Beroya mwanzo hawakuamini kila kitu kilichosemwa na Paulo lakini walienda nyumbani na kutafuta katika agano la kale kuona kama vitu walivyokuwa wanavisema vilikuwa kweli (Matendo 17:11).Kwasababu kuna manabii wa uongo wengi duniani,tunatakiwa kuzijaribu roho (1Yohana 4:1).Yesu alisema kuwa tutawatambua manabii wa kweli kwa matunda yao (Math7:15-16).

Sometimes we can learn from leaders even when they are not perfect. Jesus told the people to listen to the teaching of the Pharisees, but not to follow their actions because they did not do what they preached (Matt. 23:3).
Wakati mwingine tunaweza kujifunza kutoka kwa viongozi hata kama hawako kamili.Yesu aliwaambia watu wasikilize mafundisho ya mafarisayo lakini wasifuate matendo yao kwasababu hawakufanya yale waliyoyahubiri (Math 23:3).

## Respect leaders for the work that they do

## Waheshimu viongozi kwa kazi wanazozifanya

We respect leaders because of the work that they do and not because they are more special than us (1 Thess. 5:12–13; 1 Cor. 16:15–18).
Tunawaheshimu viongozi kwasababu ya kazi wanazozifanya na sio kwasababu wao ni muhimu kuliko sisi (1Thes 5:12-13;1Kor 16:15-18).

They are giving their time and energy to help us. They will have to give an account to God about how they were leaders to us. We make their job easier when we listen to them (Heb. 13:17).
Wanatoa muda wao na nguvu zao kwaajili ya kutusaidia sisi.Watatakiwa kutoa hesabu kwa Mungu kwa jinsi walivyotuongoza.Tunaifanya kazi yao kuwa rahisi tunapowasikiliza(Ebr 13:17).

## Respect those that are older than you

## Tuwaheshimu wale waliotuzidi umri

The elders in the church have experience from life. We need to respect them and learn from them (1 Tim. 5:1–2).
Wazee ndani ya kanisa wana uzoefu kutoka katika maisha yao.Tunatakiwa tuwaheshimu na kujifunza kutoka kwao (Tim 5:1-2).

While the younger do need to respect the elder, all of us need to respect each other (1 Pet. 5:5).
Wakati wadogo wanatakiwa kumheshimu mzee,wote tunatakiwa kuheshimiana (1Pet 5:5).
