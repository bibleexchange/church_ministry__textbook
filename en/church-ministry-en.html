<h1 id="introduction-leaders-that-are-not-like-the-world">Introduction: Leaders that are not like the world</h1>
<p>There is not a lot of information in the New Testament about the structure and function of the early church. We cannot find an exact plan in the Bible about how we should run our churches. Much of what we do in churches is from two thousand years of church history.</p>
<p>Not everything we do in the church comes directly from the Bible. That does not necessarily mean that these things are good or bad. We need to take what little we know from the Bible and compare it to our modern practices to see if we are following the principles laid out in the Bible.</p>
<p>We have to be careful that we do not copy the ideas of the world and use them in the church. As Christians, we should not look to business leaders or politicians as examples of leadership, but church leaders will be different from the leaders of natural things. What the world thinks of as a good leader is not what the Bible says is a good leader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 20:25–26 — But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also many things from our current church culture that does not come from biblical principles, but are things that were implemented by leaders who wanted to increase their power over others. When we go into our study, we have to clear our minds of all the things that we think about leadership so that we can be ready to learn what the Bible really says about leadership.</p>
<!--There is a great need for workers. Jesus said the harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few-->
<h2 id="the-things-that-matter-to-us-don-t-always-matter-to-god">The things that matter to us don&#39;t always matter to God</h2>
<h3 id="the-number-of-people-is-not-as-important-as-spiritual-growth">The number of people is not as important as spiritual growth</h3>
<p>Matthew 7:13–14 makes it clear that there will not be many people who enter the kingdom of heaven. As a leader in the church, you should not be focusing on getting many people into the church, but you should focus that the people you do have under your authority grow up spiritually (Eph. 4:11–13). Of course we can do outreach ministry to the lost, but what good is it if people come to church and remain spiritually immature?</p>
<h3 id="spiritual-gifts-are-not-as-important-as-right-relationship-with-god">Spiritual gifts are not as important as right relationship with God</h3>
<p>Some leaders look to have great power with God, but it is more important that we actually know who God is. Jesus said that in the last day, there will be people who will stand before the judgment and boast of all the miracles that they did. God will tell them to go away because He never knew them (Matt. 7:21–23).</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-leader-">What is a leader?</h2>
<h3 id="a-leader-is-servant-of-all">A leader is servant of all</h3>
<p>In all four Gospels, Jesus tells his disciples that they are supposed to be servants:</p>
<ol>
<li>Matthew 20:20–28</li>
<li>Mark 9:33–37; 10:35–45</li>
<li>Luke 22:24–27</li>
<li>John 13:12–17</li>
</ol>
<p>We call leaders in the church &quot;servants&quot; of God, but many times they are not really serving, but instead being served. As leaders, we should not look for special treatment in food, respect, or seating arrangement. When Jesus washed the feet of the disciples, that was the real work of a servant. We need to be ready to sweep floors, wash dishes, or clean the toilets if we want to be leaders in the church.</p>
<h3 id="a-leader-is-to-be-a-shepherd">A leader is to be a shepherd</h3>
<p>We are not here specifically talking about the position of pastor in the church, but all leaders in the church, no matter what their title is, is supposed to take care of the people in the church. We will talk more in a later chapter about the official title of &quot;pastor&quot; in the church.</p>
<p>A leader cares for the needs of others. The command is given two times in the New Testament for the leaders of the church to be shepherds of the flock of God (1 Peter 5:1–4; Acts 20:28). Jesus also told Peter to feed His sheep (John 21:15). The shepherd is one who takes care of all needs of the sheep, including making sure they have food and water and protecting them (Psalm 23).</p>
<p>Jesus is our example as the good shepherd who lays down His life for the sheep (John 10:11). Not everyone that is a leader in the church really cares for the people. Some will run away when things get difficult and leave the people to be scattered by the enemy (John 10:12–13).</p>
<!--Need to expound on this more, since it very specifically talks about protecting from false doctrine:

Acts 20:28–31 (KJV 1900)
28Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
29For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
30Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.
31Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
-->
<!--Titus 1:9–11 (KJV 1900)
9Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
10For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
11Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.
-->
<h4 id="the-shepherd-takes-care-of-spiritual-needs">The shepherd takes care of spiritual needs</h4>
<p>The leaders in the church should make sure that the people understand the Word of God and pray for them when they have trouble in life.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jesus went to all the villages teaching and preaching (Matt. 9:35; Mark 1:38–39)</li>
<li>Paul was a teacher (1 Tim. 2:7; 2 Tim. 1:11)</li>
<li>The overseer is to be able to teach (1 Tim. 3:2)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Colossians 1:28 — Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:</p>
</blockquote>
<!--Titus 1:9 (KJV 1900)
9Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.

He must protect against false doctrine-->
<h4 id="the-shepherd-takes-care-of-physical-needs">The shepherd takes care of physical needs</h4>
<p>In Acts chapter 6, there is a story about the apostles. They were feeding the widows daily. They said they needed to find someone else to do that work, because when they were feeding people physical food, they were not able to have the time to minister in the Word of God (Acts 6:1–8).</p>
<p>Caring for physical needs of people is a neglected aspect of Christian ministry, because like the apostles, we say we cannot leave the preaching of the Word to serve tables. But they still made sure the people were fed, even though they did not do it themselves. They found other leaders who could do that work. As a church, we cannot separate the spiritual needs of the people from the physical needs. There are many places in the New Testament that tell us to care for the physical needs of people:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jesus not only taught the people, but He also gave them physical food (Matthew 15:29–32)</li>
<li>Jesus will punish those who ignore the poor (Matthew 25:31–46)</li>
<li>The deacons and overseers were to be &quot;given to hospitality&quot; (1 Tim. 3:2; Titus 1:8)</li>
<li>&quot;Pure religion&quot; is to help the widows and orphans (James 1:27)</li>
<li>We cannot only pray for someone if they have a need, but we need to help them (James 2:15–17)</li>
<li>The early church shared all their possessions, so no one had any needs (Acts 4:32–35)</li>
<li>We do not have the love of God if we ignore the poor (1 John 3:17–18)</li>
<li>We are to help people in the church and outside of the church (Rom. 12:13; Gal. 6:10; Philippians 2:4; 1 Tim. 5:8; 6:17–18; Heb. 13:16)</li>
</ol>
<p>These commands for helping the poor are for everyone in the church and not only the leaders, but leaders need to be an example of these things.</p>
<!--Paul taking up a collection for the poor saints in Jerusalem.-->
<h3 id="a-leader-is-to-be-an-example">A leader is to be an example</h3>
<p>We cannot only tell others what to do, but we need to also do the things that we teach and preach. We should want other people imitate us and follow in what we do (Titus 2:7; Hebrews 13:7).</p>
<p>Timothy was young, so some people did not respect him. Paul told him to not let them stop them but to be an example of the faith (1 Tim. 4:12).</p>
<p>We do not force people to do what is right, but we do what is right and others will see and follow (I Pet. 5:3).</p>
<p>Jesus condemned the religious leaders because they told the people to do one thing, but did something different (Matt. 23:2–3). Paul said something similar in Romans 2:21–23.</p>
<p>If we follow Jesus, when people follow us, they are really following Jesus (1 Cor. 11:1).</p>
<h3 id="a-leader-builds-up">A leader builds up</h3>
<p>The reason that God gave ministers to the church was so that they could build up the church (Eph. 4:11–13). This is not talking about building up a building, but about people growing spiritually until they become like Jesus.</p>
<p>Every act of worship in the church should be to build up the people (1 Cor. 14:26).</p>
<p>The authority given to leaders is to be used to build up and not tear down (2 Cor. 10:8; 13:10).</p>
<p>All Christians should try to build each other up (Rom. 14:19; 15:2; I Thess. 5:11).</p>

<h1 id="symbols-of-the-church">Symbols of the church</h1>
<p>Before we talk more about the leaders of the church, we need to make sure we understand what the church is. We do not have any place in the New Testament that explains exactly what the church is and how it is supposed to function day to day. What we do have are symbols that help us understand what the church is supposed to be. &quot;What is immediately evident in these images for the church is that they all emphasize the communal aspect of Christian faith and life. This communal emphasis stands in contrast to the individualistic approach of so many of the expressions of Christianity in the modern Western world.&quot;<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<!--talk about the universal unity of the church: Ephesians 4:4–5 and John 17:20–23-->
<h2 id="the-body-1-cor-12-12-27-rom-12-4-5-">The body (1 Cor. 12:12–27; Rom. 12:4–5)</h2>
<p>In the church, there is not one human leader who is more important than all other people in the church. The head of the body is not a human, but Jesus (Col. 1:18; Eph. 1:22–23; 5:23, 30). All members of the church, including pastors, bishops, and deacons, make up the body (Col. 1:24).</p>
<h3 id="we-are-members-of-the-body-of-christ">We are members of the body of Christ</h3>
<p>All members of the body are important (1 Cor. 12:21–25). We don&#39;t use every part of the body at all times, but through the day, every part of the body is used, even if we do not think about it.</p>
<p>1 Peter 2:9 teaches us that all believers are part of the priesthood of Christ. There are some people in the church who will have gifts for leading and administration, but that does not mean that they are more spiritual or essential to the church.</p>
<p>All members of the church should be closely joined together and work well together (Eph. 4:15–16).</p>
<h3 id="each-member-has-a-different-work-or-gift">Each member has a different work or gift</h3>
<p>Each member in the church has a different role to do that cannot be done by someone else, just as the hand cannot do the work of the foot, and nor can the foot do the work of the hand. We have two lists of gifts given in the New Testament:</p>
<ol>
<li>Romans 12:6–8: prophecy, ministry, teaching, exhortation, giving, ruling, and showing mercy.</li>
<li>1 Corinthians 12:28: apostles, prophets, teachers, miracles, healings, helps, governments, and diversities of tongues.</li>
</ol>
<p>We see that these lists have different gifts in them, but both have prophecy and teaching. We should not take these to be complete lists of gifts that God can give, but just some examples of gifts.</p>
<h4 id="each-member-will-have-different-gifts">Each member will have different gifts</h4>
<p>1 Corinthians 12:29–30 makes it clear that some of these gifts will be given to someone, but not all of them. God will not give all the gifts of the spirit to one person, since that would mean that they would be proud and would not depend on other members of the church. Our limitations become our strengths when we learn to work together with people who have different strengths than we have.</p>
<h4 id="an-example-of-the-gifts-being-used-in-the-church">An example of the gifts being used in the church</h4>
<p>An example of how these different gifts work in the church can be found in Acts 6:1–6. The apostles were feeding the widows every day, but they said that they had to stop, so that they could focus on prayer and ministry of the word. They chose seven men to do the work of feeding the widows. These men were &quot;full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom.&quot; They were not less important than the apostles, but they had a different work to do.</p>
<p>Later, Stephen &quot;did great wonders and miracles among the people&quot; (Acts 6:8) and was killed because he was preaching about Jesus. Philip went to Samaria and preached the Gospel, healed the sick, and cast out demons (Acts 8:5–13). Both of these men had great spiritual power, but were humble enough to serve tables.</p>
<h2 id="temple-building">Temple/Building</h2>
<p>Even though many times we talk about the building as being the church, the church is people and not a building. We are the temple of the Holy Spirit. The church building is not the &quot;house of God,&quot; but we are the house of God. Thus, a symbol of the church is that we are all bricks in a building:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;You are God&#39;s field, God&#39;s building&quot; (1 Cor. 3:9)</li>
<li>&quot;You yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house&quot; (1 Pet. 2:5)</li>
<li>&quot;Built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets&quot; (Eph. 2:20–22)</li>
<li>&quot;The church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth&quot; (1 Tim. 3:15)</li>
</ul>
<p>Christ is the cornerstone (Matt. 21:42; Mark 12:10–11; Luke 20:17; Acts 4:11; Eph. 2:19–20; 1 Pet. 2:6–7).</p>
<h2 id="flock-sheep-john-10-1-16-acts-20-28-29-1-pet-5-2-4-">Flock/Sheep (John 10:1–16; Acts 20:28–29; 1 Pet. 5:2–4)</h2>
<p>Jesus is the shepherd, and his people are the flock.</p>
<h2 id="family-household">Family/Household</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The household of God, which is the church&quot; (1 Tim. 3:15)</li>
<li>Believers as &quot;members of the household of God&quot; (Eph. 2:19)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="branches-john-15-1-8-">Branches (John 15:1–8)</h2>
<p>In Romans 11:17–24, Paul uses the metaphor of an olive tree to describe God&#39;s people.</p>
<h2 id="field-harvest">Field/Harvest</h2>
<p>The church is portrayed as God&#39;s field (1 Cor. 3:9) and workers in his harvest (Matt. 9:37–38).</p>
<h2 id="bride-of-christ-eph-5-25-32-rev-19-7-9-21-2-">Bride of Christ (Eph. 5:25–32; Rev. 19:7–9, 21:2)</h2>
<p>Of all the symbols, this is the only one that is singular instead of being a composite or group.</p>

<h1 id="the-social-setting-of-the-early-churches">The social setting of the early churches</h1>
<h2 id="location">Location</h2>
<p>Immediately after the Day of Pentecost, we see the church started the practice of meeting every day in the house of one of its members and having a meal. Every day they would do this in someone else&#39;s house (Acts 2:46; 5:42). This practice of meeting in houses continued through all the New Testament. When Paul was in Ephesus, he acknowledged that the main way that the church spread doctrine was &quot;from house to house&quot; (Acts 20:20). Following is a list of people who had churches in their houses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Aquila and Priscilla (1 Cor. 16:19; Rom. 16:3–5)</li>
<li>Nympha (Col. 4:15)</li>
<li>Philemon (Philemon 1:1–2)</li>
<li>Lydia (Acts 16:40)</li>
<li>Possibly Gaius (Rom. 16:23)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="household-codes">Household codes</h3>
<p>Because the early church met in houses, there are several times in the epistles that we see lists of rules for each person in the family (Eph. 5:21–6:9; Col. 3:18–4; 1 Pet. 2:18–3:7). These were called &quot;household codes&quot; and they were a common thing in the Roman world.</p>
<p>1 Timothy 5:1–2 tels us that we are to treat the people in the church as family members (See also Gal. 6:10; Heb. 13:1; 1 Pet. 2:17; 1 John 3:16).</p>
<h3 id="the-church-is-people">The church is people</h3>
<p>The word church is never used in the New Testament to refer to a building, but it always refers to a group of people. We are the temple of the Holy Ghost (1 Cor. 6:19). We are the House of God, and not any building.</p>
<h2 id="transition-from-synagogues">Transition from Synagogues</h2>
<p>We must remember that the church at first did not think of itself as a new religion, but as a continuation of the Jewish religion. Many times in the New Testament, the teachings of Christ started in the Jewish synagogues. Jesus himself taught in synagogues (Luke 4:15–16; Matt. 4:23) and so did Paul immediately after he became a Christian (Acts 9:20) and on his missionary journeys to Antioch of Pisidia (Acts 13:14–16), Iconium (Acts 14:1), Thessalonica (Acts 17:1–2), and Corinth (Acts 18:4).</p>
<p>James refers to the Christian assembly as a &quot;synagogue&quot; (James 2:2).</p>
<h3 id="jewish-synagogue-worship">Jewish Synagogue worship</h3>
<p>We are not exactly sure what exactly happened in the synagogue as part of regular worship, there are some things we know from reading the New Testament:</p>
<ol>
<li>A central element was reading of Scripture (Luke 4:16–20; Acts 13:15; 15:21).</li>
<li>After readings, there was often teaching and interpretation of the Scripture (Luke 4:20–27; Acts 13:15–16).</li>
<li>There was prayer (Matt. 6:5; Mark 12:40).</li>
<li>There were special seating arrangements for wealthy and important people (Matt. 23:6; James 2:2–3).</li>
<li>There were leaders in the synagogue, though we do not know exactly what their duties were (Luke 8:41; Mark 5:22; Acts 13:15).</li>
<li>Synagogue worship took place primarily on the Sabbath (Luke 4:16; Acts 13:14; 17:2).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="christian-adoption-of-jewish-worship">Christian adoption of Jewish worship</h3>
<p>As we have said before, we do not know what worship in the early church was exactly like, either. We can assume that the early Christians that were Jewish brought some of their customs and ways of worship with them when they started forming their own places of worship. We see some ways how the early church continued in Jewish worship:</p>
<ol>
<li>The church of Jerusalem met every day in the temple courts (Acts 2:46)</li>
<li>Peter and John went to the temple to pray (Acts 3:1)</li>
<li>Paul participated in the temple purification (Acts 21:26)</li>
<li>Paul still celebrated the Jewish festivals (Acts 20:6, 16)</li>
<li>Some Christians still worshipped on the Sabbath (Acts 20:7)</li>
</ol>
<p>As time continued and more people that were not Jewish became a part of the church, the church slowly observed fewer of the Jewish practices.</p>
<h2 id="the-meaning-of-the-word-church-">The meaning of the word &quot;church&quot;</h2>
<p>The Greek word for <em>church</em> is &quot;Ekklesia.&quot; It means &quot;those called out.&quot; As with many words used by the church in the New Testament, it was not original to the church, but had a meaning in natural life. The Ekklesia was a word used in civic government for city councils.</p>
<p>The same word is used for the church in a single house, all the house churches in a city, and the universal church. When we talk of the &quot;church in Jerusalem&quot; it was not one group of people, but several house churches who probably had some form of fellowship. Because there would be several house churches in one city, that is why the terms for leadership are usually plural (1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 4:11; 1 Thess. 5:12, 13; Heb. 13:7, 17; James 5:14).<sup>[1]</sup> There would be some leaders in each house church.</p>
<h3 id="the-universal-church">The universal church</h3>
<p>Ephesians 4:4 says that &quot;there is one body,&quot; referring to the church. We know that this is true in a spiritual sense. God only has one church. But in a natural sense, there was probably never a time when there was a completely united group of people called the church. Paul writes most of his letters to combat false teaching or heal divisions in the church, so we see that even in the very beginning, there were divisions and corruptions in the church.</p>
<p>The elders and apostles wrote a letter in Acts 15 and sent it out to the churches, but who enforced it? They had no way to go to every place and make sure people followed their rules. We see that Paul later did not completely follow it or endorse it, since he taught that eating meat sacrificed to idols was not an issue.</p>

<h1 id="kinds-of-leaders-in-the-church">Kinds of leaders in the church</h1>
<p>Today we have the idea of one leader in the church, the pastor, who is responsible for all decisions in the church and who cares for both spiritual and physical needs of the church. There is indication from Scripture that in the early church there was not a singular leader, but different leaders who each had different responsibilities. Some taught and preached while others took care of physical things. There is no indication from Scripture that one position was more important than others or that one person had more power than others.</p>
<p>The New Testament gives qualifications for some positions of leadership, but it does not describe what those positions were and what they were supposed to do. We have two lists of types of leaders that have different titles in them. 1 Timothy 3:1–13 lists overseers and deacons, and Ephesians 4:11 lists apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher. In 1 Corinthians 12:28 we have a list that shares three of the titles from Ephesians 4:11 (apostles, prophets, and teachers). We can say that the list in Ephesians are people appointed by God for the good of the church and the list in 1 Timothy are leaders appointed by humans in the church. There can be overlap between these two lists. Someone can be both a pastor and an overseer and another person may be a pastor but not an overseer. The Didache, which was an early document used by the church, makes this clear by saying that people who are overseers or deacons do the ministry of prophets and teachers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Didache 15:1 — Elect, therefore, for yourselves overseers and deacons worthy of the Lord, men who are meek and not covetous, and true and approved, for they perform for you the service of prophets and teachers.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also the title &quot;elder,&quot; which is possibly a general term for any leader in the church or it is a title used for leaders in the church that are neither overseer or deacon.</p>
<p>We should not think that these lists show the only leaders and ministries in the church, but they show some of them. There can also be people who are singers, treasurers, or cooks. We see the leaders chosen in Acts for the purpose of giving food to the poor. There have been many missionaries that have been doctors and nurses.</p>
<p>Many of the words used by the church for leaders were words already commonly used in the Greek language for secular positions. This brings confusion to us because we are not always sure from the use of the word if it is talking about an official church position or just a general description of the person and what they did.</p>
<!--The earliest New Testament writings just uses "leaders" instead of specific titles (See ??). This could mean that at that time the system of organized leadership in the church had not yet been formalized. (Source ??)-->
<!--
> Now Paul goes on to speak of the specific gifts that he has given. The gifts are the people. All, in their particular ministries, are God’s gift to the church. ‘To Christ’, says Calvin, ‘we owe it that we have ministers of the gospel.’ The church may appoint people to different work and functions, but unless they have the gifts of the Spirit, and therefore are themselves the gifts of Christ to his church, their appointment is valueless.

> At the later date which some would give to this letter it would seem almost impossible not to have reference to the local ministry of bishops, presbyters and deacons which had come to be of greatest importance to the church. As it is, the apostle is not thinking of the ministers of Christ in their offices but rather according to their specific spiritual gifts and their work, and not least of those who in the exercise of their functions were not limited to a particular locality.

The Greek word for servant is doulos-->
<h2 id="coworker">Coworker</h2>
<p>The term most frequently used by Paul to describe specific individuals is &quot;co-worker,&quot; which occurs twelve times in his writing (Rom. 16:3, 9, 21; 1 Cor. 3:9; 2 Cor. 1:24; 8:23; Phil. 2:25; 4:3; Col. 4:11; I Thess. 3:2; Phlm. 1, 24).<sup>[2]</sup></p>
<h2 id="apostle">Apostle</h2>
<p>The title comes from a Greek word meaning &quot;one who is sent.&quot; There are two meanings of apostle:</p>
<ol>
<li>A messenger</li>
<li>A witness of the resurrected Christ</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="messenger">Messenger</h3>
<p>This is a title used for those that were preaching the gospel in the churches (2 Cor. 8:23; Phil. 2:25). Sometimes in the New Testament, the verb form (apostello) is used, such as when Jesus sent out the 70 in Luke 10:1.</p>
<p>Jesus was called an apostle (Heb. 3:1), probably in the sense that He brought the message of the Gospel to the world.</p>
<p>The Didache gives instructions on how to know if an apostle is true. If they ask for money or take advantage of your hospitality, then they are not a real apostle. This shows that in the early church there were people using this title to try to find personal gain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Didache 11:3–6 — And concerning the Apostles and Prophets, act thus according to the ordinance of the Gospel. Let every Apostle who comes to you be received as the Lord, but let him not stay more than one day, or if need be a second as well; but if he stay three days, he is a false prophet. And when an Apostle goes forth let him accept nothing but bread till he reach his night’s lodging; but if he ask for money, he is a false prophet.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="witness-of-the-resurrected-christ">Witness of the resurrected Christ</h3>
<p>&quot;From Paul’s words in 1 Corinthians 9:1–2 it would seem that a necessary qualification of an apostle was to have seen the risen Lord, and to have been sent out by him, and thus to have come to be engaged as a foundation member (Eph. 2:20) and worker for the building up of the church.&quot;<sup>[3]</sup></p>
<p>These are the people who are called apostles in the New Testament:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Twelve (Matt. 10:2–4; <strong>Luke 6:13</strong>; Rev. 21:14)</li>
<li>Paul (Rom. 1:1)</li>
<li>Barnabas (Acts 14:14)</li>
<li>James the Lord’s brother (Gal. 1:19)</li>
<li>Matthias (Acts 1:26)</li>
<li>Junias and Andronicus (Romans 16:7)</li>
<li>Unnamed apostles (1 Cor. 15:7)</li>
</ul>
<p>Apostles and prophets were essential to the founding of the church (Eph: 2:20). Apostles and prophets are often grouped together (Luke 11:49; Eph. 2:20; 3:5; 4:11; 1 Cor. 2:28).</p>
<p>Today we cannot be an apostle in the sense of a witness to the resurrect Christ, but we can be messengers.</p>
<h2 id="prophet">Prophet</h2>
<p>A prophet is one who speaks as a direct messenger for God. Here are some prophets in the New Testament:</p>
<ul>
<li>Barnabas, Simeon Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen (Acts 13:1–3)</li>
<li>Judas (Acts 15:32)</li>
<li>Silas (Acts 15:32)</li>
<li>Four daughters of Philip (Acts 21:8–9)</li>
<li>Agabus (Acts 21:10)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Shepherd of Hermas, which was a document used by the early church, tells how to know if a prophet is real or not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shepherd of Hermas, Mandate 11:7–8 — &quot;How, then,&quot; said I, &quot;sir, shall a man know which of them is a true prophet and which a false prophet?&quot; &quot;Listen,&quot; said he, &quot;concerning both the prophets, and as I shall tell you, so you shall judge the true prophet and the false prophet. Test the man who has the Divine Spirit by his life. In the first place, he who has the spirit which is from above, is meek and gentle, and lowly-minded, and refrains from all wickedness and evil desire of this world, and make himself poorer than all men, and gives no answers to anyone when he is consulted, nor does he speak by himself (for the Holy Spirit does not speak when a man wishes to speak), but he speaks at that time when God wishes him to speak.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="evangelist">Evangelist</h2>
<p>The meaning of Greek word is &quot;to announce news.&quot;</p>
<p>Philip was an evangelist (Acts 21:8). (In the SUV it is just translated as &quot;preacher of the Gospel.&quot;) Evangelists went to new places to convert people to Christianity and to start new churches. But they also had some aspect of ministry in the church, because Paul told Timothy, who was a leader in the church, to do the work of an evangelist (2 Tim. 4:5).</p>
<!--
> In the post-apostolic period it is the evangelists who continue to carry out many of the activities of the apostles and it is the pastors who now exercise the leadership role, alongside the teachers, previously held by the prophets
> Lincoln, A. T. (1990). Ephesians (Vol. 42, p. 250). Word, Incorporated.-->
<h2 id="pastor">Pastor</h2>
<p>The noun is only used one time in the New Testament as a word for a church leader (Eph. 4:11) and two times in the verb form (I Pet. 5:1–4; Acts 20:28).</p>
<p>Even though today this is the most common name for a church leader, we have very little information from the Bible about what the duties were of the pastor.</p>
<h2 id="teacher">Teacher</h2>
<p>Because the text says, &quot;na wengine kuwa wachungaji na waalimu&quot; and not &quot;na wengine kuwa wachungaji na <strong>wengine kuwa</strong> waalimu&quot; some people believe that these two positions are combined. &quot;It is more likely that they were overlapping functions, but that while almost all pastors were also teachers, not all teachers were also pastors. Whether the two functions were performed by a single individual within a particular local situation may well have depended on what gifted persons were present in that situation.&quot;<sup>[4]</sup></p>
<p>There are not any people in the New Testament that have the title of &quot;teacher,&quot; but there are many people who do teaching.</p>
<p>Not everyone should desire to be a teacher, because a teacher will be judged more strictly by God (James 3:1).</p>
<p>The Didache tells how to know a good teacher:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Didache 11:1–2 — Whosoever then comes and teaches you all these things aforesaid, receive him. But if the teachers himself be perverted and teach another doctrine to destroy these things, do not listen to him, but if his teaching be for the increase of righteousness and knowledge of the Lord, receive him as the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="overseer-bishop">Overseer/Bishop</h2>
<p>The Greek word is <em>episkopē</em>, which means &quot;overseer.&quot; In fact, the <em>Neno Biblia Takatifu</em> translates this to be &quot;mwangalizi.&quot; The title <em>overseer</em> &quot;in its original usage, at least until the time of Ignatius, ...was restricted to those who exercised oversight in the local church. ...the office referred to is quite general and might encompass any position, secular or ecclesiastical, where ‘oversight’ was necessary.&quot;<sup>[5]</sup></p>
<p>Some people think that overseers and deacons were the same thing, but Philippians 1:1 show them as two separate positions. 1 Timothy 3:1–7 gives a list of qualifications for the overseer. The Didache also gives a list of qualifications:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Didache 15:1–4 — Appoint therefore for yourselves overseers and deacons worthy of the Lord, meek men, and not lovers of money, and truthful and approved, for they also minister to you the ministry of the prophets and teachers. Therefore do not despise them, for they are your honorable men together with the prophets and teachers. And reprove one another not in wrath but in peace as you find in the Gospel, and let none speak with any who has done a wrong to his neighbor, nor let him hear a word from you until he repents. But your prayers and alms and all your acts perform as ye find in the Gospel of our Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--Acts 20:28 (KJV 1900)
28Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
-->
<!--Jesus is the overseer of our souls:
1 Peter 2:25 (KJV 1900)
25For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

<!--Talk about the origins of the title in civic and/or business life:

> Its adoption came about in a natural way. Just as senatus, γερουσία and πρεσβύτερος passed into official designations through the natural association of authority with age, so ἐπίσκοπος would be, almost inevitably, the designation of a superintendent. This process of natural selection was probably aided by the familiar use of the title in the clubs and guilds to designate functions analogous to those of the ecclesiastical administrator.

<h3 id="the-teaching-of-ignatius-on-church-hierarchy">The teaching of Ignatius on church hierarchy</h3>
<p>By the time of Ignatius in the second century (107 AD), there was one &quot;head&quot; bishop for each city. These were over the elders, who were over the deacons.<sup>[6]</sup> Ignatius taught that the the bishop spoke directly for God and that to disobey the bishop was to disobey God.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, Philippians 1:1 is the verse that shows us that the system of Ignatius was not what was happening in the time of Paul. This verse shows that the bishops (overseers) and elders were not over the whole congregation, but were included alongside the rest of the congregation.<sup>[7]</sup> This verse also shows more than one bishop in one city, so that goes against the idea of Ignatius that each city should have only one bishop.</p>
<p>Even if the idea of the bishop being more powerful than other people in the church does not come directly from the New Testament, by the second century, it was common in the church. Because there was only one bishop in a city, people fought for the position of bishop. Clement, who was an early church father, knew that many people would fight to be bishop. This shows that at some time, the position became to be a more prominent position in the church:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I Clement 44:1 — Our Apostles also knew through our Lord Jesus Christ that there would be strife for the title of bishop.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="deacon-servant">Deacon/Servant</h2>
<p>1 Timothy 3:8–13 gives the qualifications for deacons. The word in Greek is <em>diakonis</em>, which means &quot;servant.&quot; The <em>Biblia Habari Neno</em> translates it as &quot;wasaidizi.&quot; Greek has a different word for slave (duolos), which is not what is used here.</p>
<h3 id="unofficial-positions">Unofficial positions</h3>
<p>This can be used as an unofficial title. Jesus said all leaders in the kingdom of God have to be servants (diakonis in Greek) (Matt. 20:26). Some people who are deacons or elders could also be called servants. Paul and Apollos were called servants (1 Cor. 3:5). This word did not originally come from the church, but it was a common word used to describe many different occupations.<sup>[8]</sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The creative power of the early Church was strong enough to fashion its own offices for the conduct of congregational life and divine worship. ...Early Christianity took over words which were predominantly secular in their current usage and which had not yet been given any sharply defined sense. It linked these words with offices which were being fashioned in the community, and thus gave them a new sense which was so firmly welded with the activity thereby denoted that in all languages they have been adopted as loan-words to describe Christian office-bearers.<sup>[9]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="official-position-in-the-church">Official position in the church</h3>
<p>Because the same word is used in an official and unofficial manner, it is difficult to know when some is called a servant (a good worker in the church) or if the are being called a deacon (an actual ordained leader in the church). There are two people in the New Testament that are possibly official deacons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phoebe (Rom. 16:1)</li>
<li>Tychicus (Eph. 6:21)</li>
</ul>
<p>People who do not believe that woman can hold positions in the church say that Phoebe was only a servant. It is possible that in the early church, female deacons were called &quot;widows.&quot;</p>
<p>We sometimes think that the deacon is a lesser position than the overseer, but &quot;there is no suggestion in the text that the deacon is subordinate to the overseer. Both performed vital functions in the church, and it is the deacon who is expressly told that a reward awaits those who serve well.&quot;<sup>[10]</sup></p>
<p>When comparing the requirements for overseers and deacons in 1 Timothy chapter three, we see the difference is that deacons were not required to teach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The requirements for a deacon suggest that there would be substantial contact with people: not double-tongued; a dignified wife; faithful in marriage; a well-managed family. The requirement that they not be greedy may suggest some responsibility for the church’s purse, perhaps in the disbursement of funds to the poor.<sup>[11]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="elder">Elder</h2>
<p>This is the most common name for leaders in the church. The Greek word is <em>presbyteros</em>, which means &quot;an older person.&quot; In all Swahili translations this word is translated as &quot;mzee.&quot;</p>
<p>It could just refer to an older person in the church, but also could be an actual appointed position, as we see in Acts 14:23 when Paul and Barnabas appointed elders in the church. Titus 1:5–9 gives a list of qualifications of elders. Polycarp, who was taught by the Apostle John, also gave a list of qualifications for elders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the presbyters also must be compassionate, merciful towards all men, turning back the sheep that are gone astray, visiting all the infirm, not neglecting a widow or an orphan or a poor man: but providing always for that which is honorable in the sight of God and of men, abstaining from all anger, respect of persons, unrighteous judgment, being far from all love of money, not quick to believe anything against any man, not hasty in judgment, knowing that we are all debtors of sin.<sup>[12]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 2nd and 3rd epistles of John, John calls himself an elder and Peter also calls himself an elder (I Pet. 5:1).</p>
<p>The elders were to pray for people in the church that were sick (James 5:14).</p>
<!--Talk about the body of elders-->
<!--The word was used for leaders of the Jews before it was used by the church (Matt. 21:23; Acts 4:5)-->
<!--Elders are paired often with Apostles in the book of Acts (Acts 15:2, 4, 6, 22, 23; 16:4)-->
<!--The titles of overseer and elder are used interchangeably. Paul instructs Titus concerning elders (Titus 1:5) and then in the next breath calls them overseers (Titus 1:7) with no indication that the audience has changed. That the list of qualities in Titus 1 so closely parallels that of the overseers in 1 Tim. 3:1–7 suggests that the two terms refer to the same office. This same interchangability is found in Acts 20 where Paul calls the Ephesian elders (v 17) and tells them that as overseers (v 28) they should take care of the church.

<h1 id="modern-church-organizational-structures">Modern church organizational structures</h1>
<p>We have studied about the types of leaders in the New Testament church, but what does that mean for us today? How should our churches be organized and how should they operate?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, church [structure] has to do with who runs the church and how. This is the question of authority. Does authority lie with a single officeholder? Does it lie with elected representatives? Or does it lie with the congregation as a whole?<br>Another question that [structure] addresses is that of an individual congregation’s relationship with other congregations. Are congregations connected administratively, within a hierarchy? Are they connected spiritually, part of an interdependent network of mutual submission? Or are they not connected at all?<sup>[1]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three types of church organizational structures: Episcopal, Presbyterian, and Congregational. All of these structures agree on some fundamental truths about the church. They all believe that the church is made up of a body of people who are called to love each other and be a light to the world, but they disagree about who makes the decisions about &quot;how&quot; they perform these acts in the world. They all agree that God has given leaders to the church to help them grow up, but they disagree about how exactly they do that.</p>
<p>These three structures are shaped by the political situation at the time the church was initially formed as much as it is of any biblical influence. &quot;Thus the Episcopal system was developed largely when Emperors, Kings, and Queens ruled; the Presbyterian system was developed largely when city and state councils ruled; the Congregational system was developed largely when democratic systems ruled; and Hybrid systems have developed only in the past 100 years or so.&quot;<sup>[2]</sup></p>
<!--There is some inconsistency and overlap in these. Some church might be mostly presbyterian, but have bishops (not with apostolic succession) that step in (and maybe overstep) and push certain issues or agendas or try to "fix" problems-->
<!-- probably need some discussion about the "keys" of heaven as used in Matthew 18:15–20 and Matt. 16:17–19-->
<h2 id="the-three-types-of-church-organizational-structures">The three types of church organizational structures</h2>
<h3 id="episcopal-structure">Episcopal structure</h3>
<p>In this structure, the local church will have a pastor, and then there will be bishops over a city or a region. These bishops are under a universal authority, which differs in different organizations. In the Roman Catholic Church, this universal authority is the Pope, the Orthodox church, the universal authority is a group of patriarchs, while in other organizations, the universal authority is an archbishop.</p>
<p>The first time we see it explained was by Ignatius in a letter around the year 110 AD. This was the most common structure from the second century until the Reformation. During the Reformation, there was a move to Presbyterian and Congregational structures. In the last two centuries, there have been Protestant churches that have moved away from the ideas of the Reformation and back to a structure more closely resembling the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Some of these churches believe in &quot;apostolic succession,&quot; which means that Jesus gave power to the apostles before He left this world, then the apostles passed that power down to the next generation of leaders by the laying on of hands. They believe this process has continued since the time of the original apostles.</p>
<!--For much of the written history of institutional Christianity, episcopal government was the only known form of church organization. This changed at the Reformation. Many Protestant churches are now organized by either congregational or presbyterian church polities, both descended from the writings of John Calvin, a Protestant reformer working and writing independently following the break with the Catholic Church precipitated by The Ninety-Five Theses of Martin Luther. However, some people have disputed the episcopal polity before the reformation, such as Aerius of Sebaste in the 4th century.
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_polity-->
<!--The orthodox church has multiple leaders in the top position, instead of just one leader, like the pope in the Roman Catholic church. Both are Episcopal. -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Source of authority:</strong> Bishops.</li>
<li><strong>Key Scriptures used:</strong> Matthew 16:18; Acts 1:15–26</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="presbyterian-structure">Presbyterian structure</h3>
<p>It is said that &quot;absolute power corrupts absolutely.&quot; The Reformers, like John Calvin, felt that many of the problems in the Catholic Church were because a very few people held all the authority of the church. The two types of structures that came from the Reformation are Presbyterian and Congregational.</p>
<p>In a local Presbyterian church, there is not one pastor that makes all the decisions, but there is a group of elders that work together. This doctrine is called the &quot;plurality of elders.&quot; Some of these elders have the ability to teach and preach, but not always all of the elders can. There are then regional groups of elders that rule over the local churches and a &quot;general assembly&quot; that rules over the regional groups of elders.</p>
<p>Presbyterian churches differ from Congregational churches because they believe that it is not enough for each local church to operate on its own, but that there needs to be a universal, visible church (Eph. 4:4–5; John 17:20–23). They believe that this can only happen if there are groups of elders that unite the local churches together.<sup>[3]</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source of authority:</strong> Councils of elders.</li>
<li><strong>Key Scriptures used:</strong> Hebrews 13:17; 1 Thessalonians 5:12–13</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="congregational-structure">Congregational structure</h3>
<p>If a church is Congregational, then the local church body acts as a complete organization. One large Congregational organization in America is The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC). In this organization, &quot;each local church is autonomous while cooperating voluntarily with others for the sake of the Gospel.&quot;<sup>[4]</sup> They fellowship with other churches in the organization, but no one outside the local church can tell them what to believe or how to operate the church. The local church can leave the organization at anytime, if they want. If other churches feel that a local church has strayed from the doctrine of the organization, they can vote to remove that local church.</p>
<p>Inside the local church, there can be different ways of operating. Some have a single pastor as head who leads the congregation with no one to tell him what to do. Others give all the power to the entire congregation and all decisions will have to be voted upon. When all the congregation has power, it &quot;makes every member responsible for establishing churches, for proclaiming the gospel, and for protecting the gospel faithfulness of a church’s members. Presbyterians and episcopalians make the elders and/or bishops responsible for this work.&quot;<sup>&gt;[5]</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source of authority:</strong> Either 1) an individual pastor, or 2) the congregation</li>
<li><strong>Key Scriptures used:</strong> Matthew 18:17; 1 Corinthians 5:4; 1 Peter 2:9</li>
</ul>
<!--Not convinced that this is separate from congregational, so removing for now.
### Connectional polity

Connection is "The principle, basic to The United Methodist Church, that all leaders and congregations are connected in a network of loyalties and commitments that support, yet supersede, local concerns."
https://www.umc.org/en/content/glossary-connection, accessed March 7, 2025

> Here again, roots of a relational understanding of connection can be traced back to John Wesley. The earliest Methodist conferences were not formal organizations but rather gatherings of people that had personal relationships with Wesley. Developing Methodist organization grew out of pre-existing relationships among Wesley and the early Methodist preachers and class leaders.
> https://www.umnews.org/en/news/the-many-meanings-of-connectionalism

> A theological understanding of connectionalism affirms that the true nature of the church must include the bonds among congregations. This view contrasts with a congregational understanding of the church, in which each congregation is by itself fully the church. A belief in connectionalism is connected to beliefs about the unity of the church and the catholicity of the church.

<h2 id="which-structure-is-best-">Which structure is best?</h2>
<p>All three of these structures use Scriptures as the reason why the chose their structure. No one of the structures is necessarily more Scriptural that the others. While we may not all agree on the specific structure to use, there are some things essential to all church structures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leaders are for our good and are to be respected.</li>
<li>While there are leaders in the church, they are not the only ones who work for God. The whole church is the priesthood of God.</li>
<li>Leadership needs to be held accountable somehow. Either by answering to the congregation, the plurality of elders, or leaders above them.</li>
</ol>
<p>We see that these structures differ in how the authority is distributed in the church:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Episcopal:</strong> Very few people have authority</li>
<li><strong>Presbyterian:</strong> More people have authority that Episcopal, but fewer than Congregational</li>
<li><strong>Congregational</strong>: The most people have authority</li>

<h1 id="characteristics-of-a-good-leader">Characteristics of a good leader</h1>
<p>We have lists of characteristics that are good for overseers (1 Tim. 3:1–7), deacons (1 Tim. 3:8–13), and elders (Titus 1:5–9). While these lists are good for us to understand what Paul was looking for in a good leader, we have to remember them in their original setting. These are letters written to specific people for a reason. In part, Paul was writing to Timothy and Titus to try to stop false teachers that were causing problems in the church (1 Tim. 1:6–7; Titus 1:10–11). These were things that were opposite of what the false teachers were doing. The following table shows how the qualities of the leaders in the church are opposites of what the false teachers were doing:<sup>[1]</sup></p>

</table>
<p>We should not think that these are complete lists of what makes a good leader. Nor should we think these are all absolutes, especially the requirements to be the husband of one wife or have a household to manage, since Paul himself was not married and thus did not have a household.</p>
<p>Besides these longer lists in 1 Timothy and Titus, we have shorter lists that list qualities for leaders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acts 6:3: &quot;Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.&quot;</li>
<li>2 Timothy 2:24: &quot;And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The Didache had a similar list in 15:1–2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Appoint therefore for yourselves overseers and deacons worthy of the Lord, meek men, and not lovers of money, and truthful and approved, for they also minister to you the ministry of the prophets and teachers. Therefore do not despise them, for they are your honorable men together with the prophets and teachers.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Polycarp had a similar lists in his epistle to the Ephesians:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Likewise must the deacons be blameless before his righteousness, as the servants of God and Christ and not of man, not slanderers, not double tongued, not lovers of money, temperate in all things, compassionate, careful, walking according to the truth of the Lord, who was the &quot;servant of all.&quot;</p>
<p>And let the presbyters also be compassionate, merciful to all, bringing back those that have wandered, caring for all the weak, neglecting neither widow, nor orphan nor poor, but &quot;ever providing for that which is good before God and man,&quot; refraining from all wrath, respect of persons, unjust judgment, being far from all love of money, not quickly believing evil of any, not hasty in judgment, knowing that &quot;we all owe the debt of sin.&quot;<sup>[3]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will not go over every item in these lists, but we will combine these lists together and highlight a few things that are repeated among them.</p>
<!--
Also lists from Greek culture:

> The similarity between the list in 1 Timothy and Onosander is explained by noting the function of the list in the PE: Paul wants the church leaders to possess at a minimum those basic, observable traits that were highly regarded in pagan society. One would be surprised if Paul did not choose some of those qualities that were the common stock of the society to which he was appealing
> Mounce, W. D. (2000). Pastoral Epistles (Vol. 46, p. 166). Word, Incorporated.-->
<h2 id="character">Character</h2>
<p>All preachers can say they are called of God, but how do we know if they will really be a good leader in the church? We already said before that what makes a good leader in worldly things is not what will make a good leader in spiritual things.</p>
<p>We should not just look for someone who has a strong personality or is a &quot;powerful&quot; preacher. We need to look at how they live their lives. Jesus said we would know a tree by its fruit (Matt. 7:15–20). The only &quot;ministry&quot; ability in the lists in 1 Timothy and Titus is that the overseers and elders should be able to teach. That shows us that Paul considered character to be more important than the ability to speak.</p>
<p>These good characteristics are not things special for only leaders, but they are expected of all Christians. The leader is supposed to be an example of these characteristics.</p>
<h3 id="good-reputation-1-tim-3-2-7-8-titus-1-7-">Good reputation (1 Tim. 3:2, 7, 8; Titus 1:7)</h3>
<p>All people inside and outside the church should know that the church leader is a good person:</p>
<ul>
<li>They must be &quot;above reproach&quot; (1 Tim. 3:2)</li>
<li>They must be &quot;respectable&quot; (1 Tim. 3:2)</li>
<li>They must &quot;must have a good report of them which are without&quot; (1 Tim. 3:7)</li>
<li>They must be &quot;worthy of respect&quot; (1 Tim. 3:8)</li>
<li>They must be &quot;be blameless&quot; (Titus 1:7)</li>
</ul>
<p>This was also listed as one of the requirements for the helpers in Acts chapter six (Acts 6:3).</p>
<h3 id="temperate-1-tim-3-2-11-">Temperate (1 Tim. 3:2, 11)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The overseer is to maintain command of his reason, to be watchful and observant of things going on around him, and balanced in his assessments.<sup>[4]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was also supposed to be taught to the old men (Titus 2:2).</p>
<h3 id="self-control-1-tim-3-2-titus-1-8-">Self control (1 Tim. 3:2; Titus 1:8)</h3>
<p>The term &quot;self-control&quot; &quot;covers a range of meaning (prudence, moderation, sobriety), but gives the general sense of control over the behavior and the impulses and emotions beneath it.&quot;<sup>[5]</sup> Not everything is good for us. We need to learn to say &quot;no&quot; to the things that we want. When we come to Christ, we have to learn to deny ungodliness and worldly passions (Titus 2:11–12).</p>
<p>This is for all believers and not just for leaders (1 Tim. 2:9, 15; Titus 2:2, 4, 5, 6).</p>

<li>They must not be &quot;a brawler&quot; (1 Tim. 3:3)</li>
<li>They must not be &quot;soon angry&quot; (Titus 1:7)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="not-greedy-for-money-1-tim-3-8-titus-1-7-">Not greedy for money (1 Tim. 3:8; Titus 1:7)</h3>
<p>A leader in the church should not love money. We will talk more about leaders and money later.</p>
<h3 id="must-take-good-care-of-his-family-1-tim-3-4-12-titus-1-6-">Must take good care of his family (1 Tim. 3:4, 12; Titus 1:6)</h3>
<p>The leader in the church must first be a good leader in the home. If he cannot take care of his family, how can he take care of the church?</p>
<h3 id="hospitable-1-tim-3-2-titus-1-8-">Hospitable (1 Tim. 3:2; Titus 1:8)</h3>
<p>&quot;Given the dangers of travel in the empire and the economic uncertainties faced by many believers, the early Christian mission and churches depended upon those who would open their homes and share their goods.&quot;<sup>[6]</sup> Jesus did not have His own house, but needed to stay in the house of other people. All Christians were supposed to be ready to receive the guest into their homes (Rom. 12:13; Heb. 13:2; 1 Pet. 4:9; 3 John 1:8).</p>
<p>The Shepherd of Hermas, which was a document used for teaching in the early church, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overseers and hospitable men who at all times received the servants of God into their houses gladly and without hypocrisy; and the overseers ever ceaselessly sheltered the destitute and the widows by their ministration, and ever behaved with holiness.<sup>[7]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<!--
### Humility

Humility listed in any of the qualification lists, but part of the teaching of Jesus.-->
<h2 id="age">Age</h2>
<p>1 Timothy 3:6 says that a bishop cannot be a novice, but those that mean they must be a certain age? Timothy was a young man and some people thought he should not be a leader. Paul told him to not let other people stop him because he was young (1 Tim. 4:12).</p>
<p>This is talking about spiritual maturity, and not age. The overseer should not be a new Christian.</p>
<p>The elders still have wisdom that comes from life, so we should learn from them (Titus 2:3–4) and respect them (1 Pet. 5:5).</p>
<!--Use of the title "elder."-->
<h2 id="marital-status">Marital status</h2>
<p>Does someone have to be married to be a leader in the church? Overseers (1 Tim. 3:2), deacons (1 Tim. 3:12), and elders (Titus 1:6) were all to be the husband of one wife. In Greek, there is no difference between the words &quot;woman&quot; and &quot;wife.&quot; So in Greek, this prase is &quot;one-woman man.&quot; There are four possible meanings to what Paul said.</p>
<h3 id="possible-meaning-1-the-leader-must-be-married">Possible meaning 1: The leader must be married</h3>
<p>This is not very likely, since Paul was not married (1 Cor. 7:8). He would not tell people to do something that he does not do himself. Other apostles had wives, and Paul had that right to take a wife. He chose not to take a wife so that he would have more freedom to travel and preach the gospel (1 Cor. 9:5).</p>
<p>Paul thought it was good for people who were not married to not seek to get married (1 Cor. 7:25–28). This is because those that are not married only have to care about spiritual things, but those that are married have to care about both spiritual and natural things (1 Cor. 7:32–35). Even Jesus taught that some people choose not to marry for the kingdom of God (Matt. 19:9–12).</p>
<p>Marriage is not a sin. It can even be a good thing. But it can limit your time, resources, and ability to move about.</p>
<p>Marriage can help leaders, because they can learn to be a leader in their home and then be able to be a good leader in the church.</p>
<h3 id="possible-meaning-2-the-leader-must-not-have-more-than-one-wife-at-one-time">Possible meaning 2: The leader must not have more than one wife at one time</h3>
<p>This is not likely what Paul meant, since not many Jews or Christians practiced polygamy.<sup>[8]</sup></p>
<h3 id="possible-meaning-3-the-leader-must-be-faithful-to-his-current-wife">Possible meaning 3: The leader must be faithful to his current wife</h3>
<p>&quot;This would allow for the possibility of an overseer being remarried after a death, divorce, or possibly adultery in the distant past but would disallow polygamy and sexual immorality (even if the overseer were not married, since the guidelines would be no less stringent for the unmarried than the married).&quot;<sup>[9]</sup></p>
<h3 id="possible-meaning-4-the-leader-must-not-marry-again">Possible meaning 4: The leader must not marry again</h3>
<p>In is possible that this means that the leader should not be divorced and married again.</p>
<p>In the second century, the church widely believed that this meant that the leader should not marry a second time, even if his first wife died.<sup>[10]</sup> They believed this because the leader was supposed to be a symbol of Christ marrying the church and Christ cannot marry a second church.</p>
<!--
> We have already said, that a bishop, a presbyter, and a deacon, when they are constituted, must be but once married, whether their wives be alive or whether they be dead; and that it is not lawful for them, if they are unmarried when they are ordained, to be married afterwards; or if they be then married, to marry a second time, but to be content with that wife, which they had when they came to ordination. We also appoint that the ministers, and singers, and readers, and porters, shall be only once married. But if they entered into the clergy before they were married, we permit them to marry, if they have an inclination thereto, lest they sin and incur punishment. But we do not permit any one of the clergy to take to wife either a courtesan, or a servant, or a widow, or one that is divorced, as also the law says. (6.3.17; ANF 7:457)
> Mounce, W. D. (2000). Pastoral Epistles (Vol. 46, p. 191). Word, Incorporated.-->
<h4 id="conclusion-to-marriage-status">Conclusion to marriage status</h4>
<p>Because of the difficult Greek language, it is difficult to know exactly which of these possibilities Paul intended. Without doubt, the passages are speaking of fidelity in marriage. That is, monogamous and acceptable in the eyes of the community.<sup>[11]</sup></p>
<p>Paul included this in his list to show that it was good (although not necessary) for leaders in the church to be married. This is important, because the false teachers in Ephesus were forbidding people to be married (1 Tim. 4:3).</p>
<h2 id="gender">Gender</h2>
<p>Does a church leader have to be a man?</p>
<h3 id="in-the-bible-there-are-many-women-who-work-for-god">In the Bible, there are many women who work for God</h3>
<p>In the Old Testament:</p>
<ul>
<li>Miriam (Exodus 15:20)</li>
<li>Deborah (Judges 4:4)</li>
<li>Huldah (2 Kings 22:14; 2 Chronicles 34:22)</li>
<li>The wife of Isaiah (Isaiah 8:3)</li>
<li>Sons and daughters will prophesy (Joel 2:28–29)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the New Testament:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elisabeth (Luke 1:41–42)</li>
<li>Mary Mother of Jesus (Luke 1:46–55)</li>
<li>Anna (Luke 2:36–38)</li>
<li>Unnamed patrons (mfazili) of Jesus (Luke 8:1–3)</li>
<li>Women followers of Jesus (Mark 15:40–41)</li>
<li>Mary Magdalene (John 20:18)</li>
<li>Tabitha (Acts 9:36)</li>
<li>Lydia (Acts 16:14)</li>
<li>Priscilla (Acts 18:26)</li>
<li>Philip&#39;s daughters (Acts 21:9)</li>
<li>Phoebe (Rom. 16:1)</li>
<li>Junia (Rom. 16:7)</li>
<li>Mother of Rufus (Romans 16:13)</li>
<li>Mary, Tryphaena, Tryphosa, and Persis &quot;who has worked hard in the Lord&quot; (Romans 16:6, 12)</li>
<li>Euodia and Syntyche (Philippians 4:2–3)</li>
<li>Lois and Eunice (2 Tim. 1:5)</li>
<li>Older women who train the younger (Titus 2:3–5)</li>
<li>Peter said daughters would prophesy</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these, Jesus had deep theological conversations with women, which shows that women were able to think about the things of God.</p>
<h3 id="then-why-does-paul-say-not-to-let-women-teach-in-the-church-">Then why does Paul say not to let women teach in the church?</h3>
<p>1 Timothy 2:11–12 and 1 Corinthians 14:34–35 are two Scriptures that seem to show that Paul does not let women speak in church.</p>
<p>Some people think that because of these verses that women should not be allowed to be leaders in the church. Other people read about the women who work for God and believe that women can be leaders in the church. No matter what you decide, you have to find a way to reconcile these passages of Paul with the fact that so many women ministered in the early church.</p>
<p>It is possible that Paul was dealing with specific issues of the churches he was writing to and not overall commands to the church at large.</p>
<h3 id="possible-explanations">Possible explanations</h3>
<p>These are some of the most difficult passages in the Bible and many intelligent scholars come to different answers on both sides.</p>
<h4 id="these-are-commands-for-the-whole-church-for-all-time-and-women-should-not-be-allowed-to-speak-in-the-church">These are commands for the whole church for all time and women should not be allowed to speak in the church</h4>
<p>This is what many people believe. But it does not explain why there are so many women that worked for God in the New Testament.</p>
<h4 id="paul-was-trying-to-fix-specific-problems-with-women-in-these-churches-corinth-and-ephesus-and-they-are-not-universal-prohibitions">Paul was trying to fix specific problems with women in these churches (Corinth and Ephesus) and they are not universal prohibitions</h4>
<p>For the passage in 1 Corinthians, we know Paul was writing to fix problems of disorder in the church. Earlier in the letter he writes to fix disorder about speaking in tongues and prophesying. (There Paul says that women can pray aloud and prophesy in the church. See 1 Cor. 11:5.) When he moves to talk about women, he is possibly trying to fix a problem of the specific women in Corinth causing disruption and not trying to teach something to all churches everywhere.</p>
<p>As for 1 Timothy, there were women in the church in Ephesus that had turned away from the truth and were following false teachers (2 Tim. 3:6). It is possible that Paul was trying to stop these specific women from causing more division in the church.</p>
<h4 id="paul-was-speaking-in-cultural-contexts-and-was-trying-to-adopt-to-them">Paul was speaking in cultural contexts and was trying to adopt to them</h4>
<p>It is possible that the women in these churches were uneducated because they were not allowed to attend schools or the synagogue. Because they did not understand everything, they were asking their husbands questions and disrupting the church.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 14:34 says that the law says that women &quot;are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission.&quot; There is no Law in the Old Testament that says anything like that. It is possible that &quot;the law&quot; was not Jewish, but Roman. If that is so, there here it should be translated &quot;husband&quot; and &quot;wife&quot; instead of &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman.&quot; There were Roman laws that did not let a wife correct her husband in public.</p>
<!-- Had the Apostle heard of Gaia Afrania, wife of Licinius Buccio, a contentious lady who insisted on pleading her own causes in court, and was such a nuisance to the praetors that an edict was made prohibiting women from pleading? She died B.C. 48. For Greek sentiment on the subject see Thuc. II. xlv. 2.

<h4 id="paul-was-speaking-of-his-own-idea-and-not-an-idea-directly-from-god">Paul was speaking of his own idea and not an idea directly from God</h4>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:12, Paul says that he himself does not let women speak. He does not say it is a commandment from God. This is not the only time Paul gives advice that is not directly a commandment from God (See 1 Cor. 7:25). But Paul in other places did work with women, so this explanation is unlikely.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-on-gender">Conclusion on gender</h3>
<p>At the far ends of this debate are people who say women should do nothing at all in the church (such as the medieval church that banned congregational singing so that women would not sing) and those who see absolutely no difference between man and women in ministry. Most people fall somewhere between these two poles. Some say women cannot preach, but will let women sing and testify. Some believe women can be preachers, but not pastors or overseers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-offerings-in-the-new-testament-">What is the purpose of offerings in the New Testament?</h2>
<p>We must remember that today we use some words in a different way than they were used in the Old Testament. Today, when we say &quot;offering,&quot; we mean money. In the Old Testament, the &quot;offering&quot; was not money, but animals, grain, fruit, or drinks.</p>
<p>The sacrificial system in the Old Testament included both regular (daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly) sacrifices and various occasional sacrifices:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Daily Sacrifices</strong>: Each offering consisted of a year-old male lamb, along with grain and drink offerings (Num. 28:3–8).</li>
<li><strong>Weekly Sacrifices</strong>: Additional sacrifices were made on the Sabbath (Num. 28:9–10).</li>
<li><strong>Monthly Sacrifices</strong>: At the beginning of each month (new moon), special sacrifices were offered (Num. 28:11–15).</li>
<li><strong>Annual Sacrifices</strong>: Special sacrifices were prescribed for festivals throughout the year.<ul>
<li>Passover/Unleavened Bread (Num. 28:16–25)</li>
<li>Festival of Weeks/Pentecost (Num. 28:26–31)</li>
<li>Festival of Trumpets (Num. 29:1–6)</li>
<li>Day of Atonement (Num. 29:7–11; Lev. 16)</li>
<li>Festival of Tabernacles (Num. 29:12–38)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additionally, individuals would bring personal sacrifices for <strong>various occasions</strong> such as:<ul>
<li>Sin and guilt offerings when they transgressed (Lev. 4–7)</li>
<li>Thanksgiving offerings for blessings received (Lev. 7:12–15)</li>
<li>Offerings related to vows (Num. 15:3)</li>
<li>Purification offerings after childbirth or illness (Lev. 12–15)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The offerings were for different purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Atonement for sin (Lev. 4:20; 16:30)</li>
<li>Expressing gratitude (Lev. 7:12; Deut. 26:10)</li>
<li>Worship and devotion (Lev. 1:9; Ps. 51:19)</li>
<li>Fellowship with God (Lev. 7:15–16; Deut. 12:7)</li>
<li>Ritual purification (Lev. 12:6–7; 14:19–20)</li>
<li>Maintaining the sanctuary (Num. 18:8; Ex. 30:16)</li>
<li>Covenant renewal (Ex. 24:5–8; 2 Kings 23:3)</li>
</ol>
<p>The priests and other Levites were not to have their own farms, so they depended on the tithes and offerings to survive. The main way that they lived was through the tithe, which was completely given to the Levites (Num. 18:21–28). The tithe would not be brought to the temple, but gathered together by the Levites in each town (Neh. 10:37–38). There was also a special tithe every three years that was not only for the Levites, but also for foreigners, orphans, and widows (Deut. 14:28–29). The priests in the temple also ate part of some of the offerings:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Burnt Offerings</strong>: These were completely consumed by fire on the altar, so nobody ate them (Lev. 1:9).</li>
<li><strong>Grain Offerings</strong>: A portion was burned on the altar, but the remainder was given to the priests to eat (Lev. 6:16–18).</li>
<li><strong>Peace Offerings</strong>: These were shared three ways. A portion was burned on the altar for God, certain parts were given to the priests (Lev. 7:31–34), and the remainder was eaten by the worshipper and their family.</li>
<li><strong>Sin Offerings</strong>: For most sin offerings, the priests were to eat the meat in the sanctuary area (Lev. 6:26).</li>
<li><strong>Guilt Offerings</strong>: Similar to sin offerings, the priests were to eat these in a holy place (Lev. 7:6).</li>
</ol>
<!--different levels of offerings based on if they were poor or rich-->
<h2 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-offerings-in-the-new-testament-church-">What is the purpose of offerings in the New Testament church?</h2>
<h3 id="the-offerings-were-symbols-that-pointed-forward-to-christ">The offerings were symbols that pointed forward to Christ</h3>
<p>Many things in the temple worship were symbols that were fulfilled in the life and person of Christ. Jesus did not come to destroy the Law of Moses, but to fulfill it (Matt. 5:17–20). Because He fulfilled the Law, we no longer follow all the rules of sacrificing animals.</p>
<h4 id="christ-offered-his-life-for-our-sins">Christ offered His life for our sins</h4>
<p>Jesus came as the Lamb of God, Who would take away the sin of the world (John 1:29; 1 Pet. 1:18–19). When Jesus died on the cross, He became the final sacrifice for sins (Heb. 9:26; 10:11–14).</p>
<h4 id="we-offer-our-lives-to-christ">We offer our lives to Christ</h4>
<p>There were offerings of thanks in the Old Testament. For us as Christians, we do not just give a portion of our possessions as thanks, but we give our entire lives to God to use as He wills (Rom. 12:1). This includes <strong>everything</strong> we own, and not just a portion of it. When we give our possessions to help other people, they are like sacrifices to God (Heb. 13:16; Phil. 4:18). Our praise also is a sacrifice to God (Heb. 13:15; 1 Pet. 2:5).</p>
<p>The churches in Macedonia were poor, but they wanted to help the people in Judea who were poor and hungry because of famine. It was said of them that they gave themselves first to the Lord and then they gave themselves also to help the poor (2 Cor. 8:5). Later in this chapter, we will talk more about this famine and how the church helped in that time of trouble.</p>
<h3 id="it-does-not-matter-the-amount-of-the-offering-but-the-heart">It does not matter the amount of the offering, but the heart</h3>
<p>In Mark 12:41–44, we see the story of when Jesus watched the people bring the money to give to the temple. Many people were bringing large amounts of money. There was one woman who gave only two small coins. This was not a big value, but it was <strong>all she had</strong>. Jesus told His disciples that this woman gave more than everyone else because she gave all that she had (See also Luke 21:1–4). Paul repeated this idea when he told the church in Corinth that &quot;if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have&quot; (2 Cor. 8:12).</p>
<p>Jesus said that it was good for people in the Jewish religion to give the tithe, but there were things that were more important, such as judgment, mercy, and faith (Matt. 23:23).</p>
<p>If our heart is not right, we should take care of that first before bringing a gift to God (Matt. 5:23–24).</p>
<p>When we give, we should make sure we have a good reason for giving in our heart. We should not give because we feel we have to, but we should give with a cheerful heart to be a blessing to God and to other people (2 Cor. 9:6–7).</p>
<h4 id="give-with-no-expect-of-return">Give with no expect of return</h4>
<p>When we give to people, we give it as to God and we do not expect anything in return (Luke 6:35; 14:12–14). We do not give to get blessings, but we give to say thanks to God for what He has already done for us (2 Cor. 9:12).</p>
<p>There are many preachers that like to say that if you give money to God, then He will give you ten times that money back. Luke 6:38 is a major verse that they use to preach this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luke 6:38 — Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we read the verses around this, we see it is part of a larger conversation about how we interact with our neighbors and enemies (v. 24–37). Jesus said to give without expect of return (34–35). There is an aspect of judgment from God based on how we treat others. Because it says &quot;it shall be given to you&quot; does not necessarily mean kind for kind. When we give, God will give good things to us, though it is likely spiritual blessings (1 Tim. 6:17–19; Eph. 1:3; Acts 20:35). Psalm 41:1–3 also shows how God will bless those that give to the poor with protection and health.</p>
<p>Luke 14:14 says that when we give, we should not look for something in return immediately, but we &quot;will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.&quot; Matthew 25:31–35 also show that our reward for giving will be in the new heaven and earth.</p>
<p>While God may give us spiritual blessings, we are not buying them with our offerings. We cannot buy spiritual things (Acts 8:9, 13, 18–20).</p>
<!--
Proverbs 19:17
"Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the LORD, and he will reward them for what they have done."
Deuteronomy 15:10
"Give generously to them and do so without a grudging heart; then because of this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to."-->
<!-- Study further Matthew 19:29 and parallel passages in the synoptic Gospels. It looks like it promotes prosperity gospel -->
<h4 id="god-blesses-us-so-we-can-give-to-others">God blesses us so we can give to others</h4>
<p>If we do receive physical or financial blessings from God, they are not for us to keep for ourselves, but that we can keep giving (2 Cor. 9:8–11). Romans lists giving as one of the spiritual gifts, alongside prophesy and teaching (Rom. 12:8). There will be some people in the church that will be blessed with wealth so that they can help other people.</p>
<p>James warns the rich about the coming judgment because they did not help the poor (James 5:1–3) and so did Jesus (Matt. 25:41—46).</p>
<h4 id="we-give-to-god-and-not-so-man-can-see">We give to God and not so man can see</h4>
<p>Jesus taught that when we give, we should not give so that people can see (Matt. 6:1–4). We do not even let our left hand know what our right hand is doing. That means that we should give and forget about it. Do not go home and think that you are very righteous for your giving.</p>
<p>We see this attitude of people in weddings and send-offs. People will dance with their gift showing everyone what they are giving. But would they give the same thing if there was no one looking?</p>
<h3 id="the-collections-in-the-church-were-for-the-poor">The collections in the church were for the poor</h3>
<!-- Need to study on Greek words used for giving in the new testament. Ye olde Chat GPT gave me this:

In the New Testament, several Greek words are used to convey the concept of giving, each with distinct nuances. Here are some key Greek words related to giving:

    δίδωμι (didōmi) – This is the most common word for giving, meaning to bestow, grant, or offer. It appears frequently in the New Testament (e.g., Matthew 7:7, John 3:16, Acts 20:35).

    χαρίζομαι (charizomai) – Derived from charis (grace), it means to give freely, to grant as a favor, or to forgive (e.g., 2 Corinthians 2:7, Colossians 2:13).

    μεταδίδωμι (metadidōmi) – This word emphasizes sharing or imparting something with others, especially in generosity (e.g., Romans 12:8, Luke 3:11).

    παραδίδωμι (paradidōmi) – Often translated as deliver or hand over, this word can refer to giving in the sense of entrusting or yielding something (e.g., 1 Corinthians 11:23, referring to the Lord’s Supper).

    δωρέομαι (doreomai) – This verb means to grant or bestow as a gift, emphasizing the generosity of the giver (e.g., 2 Peter 1:3).

    δωρεά (dōrea) – A noun meaning gift, often used to refer to divine gifts, such as the gift of the Holy Spirit (e.g., Acts 2:38, Romans 5:15).

    ἀποδίδωμι (apodidōmi) – Meaning to give back or repay, used in contexts of reward, recompense, or returning something (e.g., Matthew 6:4, Luke 19:8).

    προσφέρω (prospherō) – Often used in the sense of offering a sacrifice or presenting something before God (e.g., Hebrews 9:14, Matthew 5:23).

    ἔκδιδωμι (ekdidōmi) – Less commonly used, meaning to give out or lease (e.g., Mark 12:1 in the Parable of the Vineyard).
-->
<p>In the first century, there was a famine in Judea (Jerusalem and the surrounding cities and villages). The churches outside of Judea decided that they should help the people in Jerusalem, so they gave money to Paul and Barnabas to bring back to Jerusalem (Acts 11:27–30).</p>
<p>This was a very important task for the church. When the apostles in Jerusalem sent Paul and Barnabas to go preach to the gentiles, they told them to also make sure that they continue to remember the poor (Gal. 2:9–10). The work of preaching works together with the work of helping the poor.</p>
<p>The christians thought it was important to help the Jews in Judea because the Christians received a spiritual blessing from them. The Jews had been the keepers of the Word and covenant of God. Since the Jews gave a spiritual blessing, it was good to give them a natural blessing in return (Rom. 15:26–27).</p>
<p>In both letters to the Corinthians, Paul wrote to them about this collection:</p>
<ol>
<li>They were to collect money on the first day of the week (1 Cor. 16:1).</li>
<li>Each person should give a sum of money keeping with their income. That is, those that were rich were expected to give more than those that were poor (1 Cor. 16:2; 2 Cor. 8:12).</li>
<li>Paul gave them testimony about how the churches in Macedonia gave:<ul>
<li>They were poor, but still gave generously with &quot;overflowing joy&quot; (2 Cor. 8:1–2).</li>
<li>They gave as much as they were able to, even beyond their ability (2 Cor. 8:3).</li>
<li>They pleaded to be able share in &quot;this service to the Lord’s people&quot; (2 Cor. 8:4).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They excelled in spiritual gifts, so they should also excel in giving (2 Cor. 8:7).</li>
<li>Paul did not force them to give, but wanted them to give out of love (2 Cor. 8:8).</li>
<li>Jesus is our example in giving, because He was rich, but He became poor so that we could be rich (2 Cor. 8:9).</li>
<li>They had started giving the year before, and Paul encouraged them to help finish the project (2 Cor. 8:10–11).</li>
<li>The goal of the collection was equality. It would be difficult for the Corinthians to give to help the poor in Judea, but at the time the Judeans needed the money more than the Corinthians did. There might later come a time when the Corinthians churches need help and the Judean churches would be able to return the help (2 Cor. 8:13–15).</li>
<li>They should give as generously, and not grudgingly (2 Cor. 9:5, 7).</li>
<li>If they give little, they will receive little (2 Cor. 9:6).</li>
<li>If they give, God will increase their &quot;store of seed&quot; and &quot;enlarge the harvest of [their] righteousness.&quot; This signifies both material and spiritual reward (2 Cor. 9:8–10).</li>
<li>The material reward that they get from God is so that they will be able to keep giving (2 Cor. 9:11).</li>
<li>Their giving not only helps people, but is a form of thanks to God (2 Cor. 9:12).</li>
<li>Their giving will also cause other people to give thanks to God (2 Cor. 9:13–15).</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to know more about the collection for the poor in Judea, read 1 Corinthians 16:1–4, 2 Corinthians 8:1–15, 9:1–15, and Acts 24:17.</p>
<p>This is the only specific time in the New Testament where we see the church asking for money, and it was not for themselves, but for other people who were poor.</p>
<!--
> "blessing," and "divine service."16 All of this together suggests that the "collection" was not some mere matter of money, but was for Paul an active response to the grace of God that not only ministered to the needs of God’s people but also became a kind of ministry to God himself, which resulted in thanksgiving toward God and in a bond of fellowship between "God’s people" across the Empire.

<h3 id="not-only-do-we-give-in-a-collection-in-the-church-but-we-give-to-the-poor-when-they-ask">Not only do we give in a collection in the church, but we give to the poor when they ask</h3>
<p>Sometimes we give in church and we think that we don&#39;t need to give any more. But the New Testament makes it clear that a large part of our giving should be our own personal contributions to the poor:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give to him that asks (Matt. 5:42; Luke 6:30).</li>
<li>If you have two shirts, give to someone who has none (Luke 3:11).</li>
<li>Sell your possessions and give to the poor (Matt. 19:16–22; Luke 12:33–34).</li>
<li>We do not have the love of God if we do not help the poor (1 John 3:17–18).</li>
<li>It is not enough just to say spiritual words to people and not help them materially (James 2:15–16)</li>
</ol>
<p>Dorcas is an example of a Christian who was always helping the poor (Acts 9:36).</p>
<h2 id="the-church-is-supposed-to-share-with-each-other">The church is supposed to share with each other</h2>
<p>After the day of Pentecost, the believers shared all their possessions and gave what they did not need to the poor (Acts 2:44–45; 4:34–35). They sold their land and gave the money to the apostles to use to help the poor.</p>
<p>There was a married couple named Ananias and Sapphira. They sold their land to bring the money to the apostles. They wanted to keep some of the money, but they also wanted the recognition for giving all their money to the poor. They lied and said that what they brought was all the money. Because of their lying, they died. Their sin was not keeping something back, but lying about it. This teaches us that this giving is voluntary. God wants us to give because we want to, and not because we are forced to (Acts 5:1–11).</p>
<p>Paul encouraged the church to help each other (Rom. 12:13; Gal. 6:9–10). His goal was that there would be equality in the church (2 Cor. 8:13–15).</p>
<h2 id="should-pastors-get-money-for-their-work-">Should pastors get money for their work?</h2>
<p>We saw that in the Old Testament, the Levites did not own lands or farms, so they needed the tithes and offerings to live. But what does that mean for the New Testament? We have also seen that leaders come from God and are good for the building up of the church. If they are doing the work of God, how will they find the way to live?</p>
<h3 id="leaders-should-not-be-looking-for-money">Leaders should not be looking for money</h3>
<p>In all three of the lists of requirements for leaders in 1 Timothy chapter three and Titus chapter one say that the leader &quot;should not be greedy for money&quot; (1 Tim. 3:3, 8; Titus 1:7) and Peter also agreed with this (1 Pet. 5:2).</p>
<p>This is because money is dangerous. 1 Timothy 6:6–10 teaches that the love of money is the root of all evil. Jesus said that it is very hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of God (Mark 10:23–25). This is because if we already have all that we need, then we will not trust in God to help us (Luke 6:24; Pro. 30:7–9).</p>
<h3 id="we-should-not-try-to-sell-the-gospel">We should not try to sell the gospel</h3>
<p>There were some false teachers who tried to make a profit off the Gospel (1 Tim. 6:5; Titus 1:11). This is not good because salvation is a gift from God (Rom. 3:23–24; 5:15–17; 6:23; 2 Cor. 9:15; Eph. 2:8–9; 1 Pet. 1:18–19; Rev. 22:17). Jesus said that we should freely give, because we have freely received (Matt. 10:8). We do not sell the Word of God for profit (2 Cor. 2:17).</p>
<h3 id="in-theory-it-is-good-for-church-workers-to-find-money-for-their-labor">In theory, it is good for church workers to find money for their labor</h3>
<p>Paul taught that it was good to take care of leaders in the church. He quotes from
Deuteronomy 25:4 and says &quot;Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain&quot; and from Deuteronomy 24:15 when he says &quot;Workers deserve their wages&quot; (1 Tim. 5:17–18). If we receive instruction from teachers, then it is good to give material things back to them (Gal. 6:6).</p>
<!--Maybe expand on this with 1 Cor. 9:6–13. It gives a lot more examples of why someone should expect return for their work.-->
<p>Jesus received help to do His ministry (Luke 8:1–3). Jesus told the twelve (Matt. 10:5–15) and the seventy (Luke 10:4–5) to not bring money with them when they traveled. They were supposed to depend on other people to take care of them.</p>
<p>The early church fathers believed that it was good to help the prophets, as they say in Didache 13:1–7:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But every true prophet who wishes to settle among you is &quot;worthy of his food.&quot; Likewise a true teacher is himself worthy, like the workman, of his food. Therefore thou shalt take the firstfruit of the produce of the winepress and of the threshing-floor and of oxen and sheep, and shalt give them as the firstfruits to the prophets, for they are your high priests. But if you have not a prophet, give to the poor. If thou makest bread, take the firstfruits, and give it according to the commandment. Likewise when thou openest a jar of wine or oil, give the firstfruits to the prophets. Of money also and clothes, and of all your possessions, take the firstfruits, as it seem best to you, and give according to the commandment.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="paul-chose-not-to-use-this-right">Paul chose not to use this right</h3>
<p>After reading those Scriptures, it would seem that the answer is clear: &quot;It is good to give to church workers.&quot; The problem is, we know from Scripture that just because something is good to do, doesn&#39;t mean that it is always best that we do that thing (1 Cor. 10:23).</p>
<p>Paul recognized that it was his right to receive for doing the work of the Gospel, but he chose not to use that right (1 Cor. 9:14–18. For more clarification, also read verses 6–13). In verse 14, he is referring to when Jesus sent out the seventy (Luke 10:1–7).</p>
<p>Why did Paul choose to not take money? He did not want to hinder the Gospel (1 Cor. 9:12). He thought that if he took money, then in the mind of some people, they would think he was only doing the ministry for the money. This would make the Gospel void (1 Corinthians 9:15).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Corinthians 9:18 — What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also knew that some of the churches that he visited were poor, and he did not want to be a burden to them (2 Cor. 11:8–9; 1 Thess. 2:9–10).</p>
<h3 id="church-leaders-should-be-willing-to-work-with-their-hands">Church leaders should be willing to work with their hands</h3>
<p>Paul could have taken money for himself, but instead he worked. Paul was a tent maker, and even when he was on his missionary trips, he could stop in one place and work to find money to live (Acts 18:1–4; 20:33–35). When he was in Thessalonica, he did not eat anyone&#39;s food without paying for it (2 Thess. 3:8). He hoped that by working, the people would see his example and stop being idle (2 Thess. 3:6–13).</p>
<p>Didache 12:1–5 says something similar to the teaching of Paul:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let everyone who &quot;comes in the Name of the Lord&quot; be received; but when you have tested him you shall know him, for you shall have understanding of true and false. If he who comes is a traveller, help him as much as you can, but he shall not remain with you more than two days, or, if need be, three. And if he wishes to settle among you and has a craft, let him work for his bread. But if he has no craft provide for him according to your understanding, so that no man shall live among you in idleness because he is a Christian. But if he will not do so, he is making traffic of Christ; beware of such.<sup>[2]</sup></p>

<h1 id="delegation-of-authority-and-training-others">Delegation of authority and training others</h1>
<p>Some leaders are afraid of sharing the authority with others. They want to have all the power. But the church is a body and is is bigger than any one person. There is no way that one person can fulfill all the work of God.</p>
<p>We see in Exodus a story about Moses. Moses sat all day listening to the problems of the people and doing the work of a judge. He had a relative come to visit, and when the relative saw the work of Moses, he suggested that Moses share that work with others:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exodus 18:21 — Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="make-disciples-of-all-nations">Make disciples of all nations</h2>
<p>Before Jesus ascended to heaven, He gave a final commandment to His disciples. He told them to take the Gospel into all the world. The Greek that is used is best translated to &quot;go into all the world and make disciples&quot; (Matt. 28:18–20).</p>
<p>It was always the plan of Jesus to teach disciples, who would then teach other disciples. This process of disciples making more disciples would continue until all the world had the opportunity to become disciples of Jesus. Paul told Timothy to teach people and give them authority to teach others (2 Tim. 2:2).</p>
<h3 id="jesus-and-the-twelve">Jesus and the twelve</h3>
<p>Jesus spent a lot of time teaching the twelve disciples. He took every opportunity that He could to teach them. He taught them while they were walking down the road, when they were in the boat, and when they were sitting at the table to eat food.</p>
<p>He made sure that they were ready to continue His ministry. He sent them out to preach and gave them power to heal sicknesses and cast out demons (Matt. 10:1; Mark 3:13–15).</p>
<!--greater works will you do-->
<h3 id="jesus-and-the-seventy">Jesus and the seventy</h3>
<p>It was not only the twelve that Jesus prepared for ministry, but in Luke 10:1–9, Jesus sent out seventy people to go before Him to the villages to preach and heal people. This was to prepare the people to be ready to hear the message of Jesus. He gave them complete authority to speak on His behalf (Luke 10:16).</p>
<h3 id="elders-and-the-younger">Elders and the younger</h3>
<p>Those that are elders in the church should train those that are younger (Titus 2:3–4).</p>
<p>Paul trained Timothy in spiritual things. He became a spiritual father to him. He gave Timothy authority to continue the work that he started.</p>
<ol>
<li>Paul took Timothy to work with him in ministry (Phil. 2:22)</li>
<li>Paul sent Timothy to continue his work (1 Cor. 4:17; 16:10–11)</li>
<li>Paul called Timothy his coworker (1 Thess. 3:2–3)</li>
<li>Paul left Timothy in Ephesus to try to stop the false teachers (1 Tim. 1:3–4)</li>
<li>Paul encouraged Timothy to continue in the work and to not be afraid or let other people stop him (1 Tim. 4:12–14; 2 Tim. 1:6–7; 2:1–2; 3:14–15)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="appointing-church-leaders">Appointing church leaders</h2>
<p>It is true that it is God who calls people to ministry and gives them spiritual gifts to do that work, but it helps the church when we officially recognize leaders as being sent by God.</p>
<ol>
<li>Paul appointed leaders in the churches as he traveled (Acts 14:23)</li>
<li>Paul left Titus in Crete so that he could appoint elders in the churches (Titus 1:5)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="we-see-sometimes-when-this-appointment-was-made-by-the-group-of-elders">We see sometimes when this appointment was made by the group of elders</h3>
<p>This was not just the decision of one leader to choose other leaders, but all the leaders in a church were to be in agreement:</p>
<ol>
<li>Timothy received his gift when the elders laid hands on him (1 Tim. 4:14 )</li>
<li>Paul was sent on his first missionary trip after the elders in Antioch laid hands on him and prayed for him (Acts 13:1–3)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="people-should-be-tested-before-being-made-leaders">People should be tested before being made leaders</h3>
<p>We should not be quick to choose leaders in the church (1 Tim. 5:22), but we should test them to make sure that they will be good leaders (1 Tim. 3:10).</p>
<p>This is why Paul gave lists for the qualification of leaders in 1 Timothy chapter three and Titus chapter one.</p>
<h2 id="sending-by-the-church">Sending by the church</h2>
<p>Sometimes the church would chose to send someone to do a specific task.</p>
<ol>
<li>Judas and Silas were sent with a letter from the elders (Acts 15:22–27). After reading the letter, Judas and Silas exhorted more about what the meaning of the letter was (Acts 15:32).</li>
<li>Titus and an unnamed brother were sent by the church to bring the collection to Jerusalem (2 Cor. 8:16–19).</li>
<li>The Philippian church sent Epaphroditus to help Paul (Philippians 2:25).</li>
<li>The church in Jerusalem sent Peter and John to Samaria to help Philip (Acts 8:14).</li>
<li>The church in Jerusalem sent Barnabas to Antioch to evangelize (Acts 11:22).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-process-of-some-people-being-chosen-as-leaders">The process of some people being chosen as leaders</h2>
<h3 id="the-disciples">The disciples</h3>
<p>Jesus called most of His disciples in a similar way. They were doing their normal work, Jesus came by and simply called for them to follow, and they left what they were doing to follow Him.</p>
<ol>
<li>Peter and Andrew (Matt. 4:18–20)</li>
<li>James and John the sons of Zebedee (Matt. 4:21–22)</li>
<li>Philip (John 1:43–44)</li>
<li>Nathanael, also known as Bartholomew (John 1:45–49)</li>
<li>Matthew, also known as Levi (Matt. 9:9; Mark 2:14)</li>
<li>Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, Judas son of James, also known as Thaddaeus. We have no record of them being called, but we wee them listed among the other disciples in Luke 6:12–16.</li>
<li>Judas Iscariot. We do not have record of how he was called, but Jesus says that he was called (John 6:70–71).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mathias-acts-1-23-26-">Mathias (Acts 1:23–26)</h3>
<p>The apostles wanted to chose someone to take the place of Judas Iscariot after he killed himself. There were two men that they thought would be good to replace Judas: Joseph or Matthias. But how would they choose which one? First, they prayed to God to show them. That is not surprising. What is surprising is that they next write the names of the two men on paper and randomly choose one. They believed that it was not really random, but that God would guide their hand to make the correct choice. This is the only time in the New Testament where we see a leader chosen in this way, but this process was used other times in the Old testament to make decisions.</p>
<h3 id="helpers-that-feed-the-widows-acts-6-1-6-">Helpers that feed the widows (Acts 6:1–6)</h3>
<p>The Apostles wanted to find seven leaders to help serve food to the widows. They chose men who were honest, full of the Holy Spirit, and full of wisdom. After they chose the men, they prayed and laid their hands on them.</p>
<h3 id="paul">Paul</h3>
<ol>
<li>Paul was called by Jesus (Acts 9:3–6)</li>
<li>He was baptized by Ananias (Acts 9:17–18)</li>
<li>He immediately started preaching (Acts 9:20–21)</li>
<li>Later, the elders in Antioch laid hands on him and sent him on his first missionary trip (Acts 13:1–3)</li>
</ol>

<!--## The removal of leaders

Does this mean that a leader is always a leader, even if he sins? Does it mean that if someone is a pastor that they are always a pastor? (I think not)

Romans 11:29 (KJV 1900)
29For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

1 Timothy 5:19–20:
"Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may take warning."

<h1 id="dealing-with-problems-in-the-church">Dealing with problems in the church</h1>
<h2 id="councils-in-jerusalem">Councils in Jerusalem</h2>
<p>There are three times in the book of Acts when the apostles and elders met together in Jerusalem. All three of them were about ministry among the gentiles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acts 11:1–18: After Peter went to the house of Cornelius, they discussed if gentiles could be baptized.</li>
<li>Acts 15:1–35: They discussed if gentile converts needed to be circumcised and follow the Mosaic Law.</li>
<li>Acts 21:17–26: They discussed Paul&#39;s ministry to the gentiles.</li>
</ol>
<p>We see from these councils, that when there was a question of doctrine in the church, the leaders all met together to agree about the right answer. This was continued in church history with councils like the ones at Nicea (325 AD), Ephesus (431 AD), and Chalcedon (451 AD). As time continued and there became many divisions in the church, these universal councils stopped, but there have recently been efforts to unite Christians across different organizations, such as the World Council of Churches.</p>
<h2 id="we-need-humility-when-trying-to-fix-problems">We need humility when trying to fix problems</h2>
<p>In Matthew 7:1–5, Jesus teaches us about judging others. We need to be very careful when judging others, because we might also have the sin in our lives. We need to make sure that we remain humble and recognize our human weakness to sin.</p>
<h2 id="we-need-to-listen-before-we-judge-others">We need to listen before we judge others</h2>
<p>In Matthew 18:15–17, Jesus gives three steps for correcting someone in the church:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to them by yourself</li>
<li>If they do not listen, go again with one or two elders</li>
<li>If he still does not listen, tell the church about the sinner</li>
</ol>
<p>We should not listen to an accusation against an elder unless there are two or three witnesses that make the same accusation (1 Tim. 5:19–20).</p>
<p>Paul says that if someone is causing division in the church, you should warn them twice before removing them from the church (Titus 3:10–11).</p>
<p>The sins that Paul are most concerned about are the sins that would cause division in the church:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disobedience (2 Thess. 3:6; 3:14–15)</li>
<li>False teaching (Rom. 16:17–18; 1 Tim. 6:3–5; 2 Tim. 3:5; 2 John 1:9–11)</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides these, 1 Corinthians 5:11 also lists sexually immorality, greed, idolatry, slandering, drunkenness, and swindling.</p>
<p>When possible, when there are problems between two people in the church, that problem should be solved inside the church instead of going to the civic government (1 Cor. 6:1–8).</p>
<!-- I think I need to study this more before including
Addressing serious sin in the congregation:

> 1 Corinthians 5:1–13 (ESV)
> "It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you... When you are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus... you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord."-->
<h2 id="we-need-to-know-what-things-are-important-enough-to-separate-about">We need to know what things are important enough to separate about</h2>
<p>We see that there are times to separate from other Christians, but how do we know exactly when to separate?</p>
<p>Paul teaches in Romans chapter 14 about how to handle differences of beliefs between Christians. Some Christians did not want to eat meat that had been offered to idols, but other Christians knew that the idol was not real, so there was no sin in eating the meat. There was also debate about holy days. Some Christians wanted to keep holy days, but others felt that all days were the same. Paul told them not to judge each other on these things (Rom. 14:10–13). All people did what they did for the glory of God (Rom. 14:6).</p>
<p>Paul also says that we should be careful not to offend other Christians who believe differently than we do. If someone does not believe in eating meat offered to idols, then we should not eat the meat when they are around (Rom. 14:20–21. See also 1 Cor. 8:1–13 and 10:23–33).</p>
<p>A good example of doing things to not offend other believers is when Paul circumcised Timothy in Acts 16:1–3. Paul did not believe that circumcision was needed for salvation (Gal. 5:6), but he still circumcised Timothy so that other believers would be ready to listen to him.</p>
<p>There are some things from this we can do to keep our heart right when dealing with differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone should be fully convinced in their own mind of what is right (Rom. 14:5)</li>
<li>Whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God (Rom. 14:22)</li>
<li>Make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification (Rom. 14:19)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="no-jealousy-of-other-workers">No jealousy of other workers</h2>
<p>As we see in church history, many divisions in the church are not actually about doctrine, but about power. People disagree about who should be the leader and so they separate. This is not a good reason to separate.</p>
<p>We see this in the early church. Some Christians were creating groups around the teachings of certain church leaders. Some joined to Paul, others to Apollos, and others to Cephas. Paul corrected this thinking by reminding them that only Jesus is worthy of our allegiance, since only Jesus died for us and we are baptized in the name of Jesus and not in the name of any human (1 Cor. 1:10–17).</p>
<p>These leaders are only servants of God. We each do different things in the Kingdom of God, but it is only God that brings real spiritual change (1 Cor. 3:3–11, 21–23).</p>
<p>Why do we have so many divisions in the church? If we go to a village and want to start a church, we should think about what churches are already in that village. If we are Pentecostal and there is already a Pentecostal church in that village of a different organization, we should consider going to that church and helping them instead of starting a new church.</p>
<h2 id="we-need-to-allow-those-who-repent-back-into-the-church">We need to allow those who repent back into the church</h2>
<ol>
<li>If someone sins, we should try to help restore them (Gal. 6:1)</li>
<li>If someone wanders from the truth, we should try to bring them back (James 5:19–20)</li>
</ol>
<p>We should be careful not to be very hard to those that have sinned. We should forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow (2 Cor.s 2:5–8).</p>
<!--Note here in 2 Corinthians 2:5–8, that there is some kind of vote to decide about punishing someone-->
<h2 id="disputes-in-the-new-testament">Disputes in the New Testament</h2>
<p>There are some times in the New Testament when people disagreed. We cannot make doctrine out of how they solved these issues, but we can learn wisdom in the decisions that they made.</p>
<h3 id="peter-s-inconsistent-behavior-gal-2-11-14-">Peter&#39;s inconsistent behavior (Gal. 2:11–14)</h3>
<p>Paul confronted Peter (Cephas) publicly when Peter stopped eating with Gentile believers after certain Jews arrived. Paul addressed this hypocrisy directly, emphasizing that justification comes through faith in Christ, not by observing the law.</p>
<h3 id="paul-and-barnabas-disagreed-about-john-mark-acts-15-36-41-">Paul and Barnabas disagreed about John Mark (Acts 15:36–41)</h3>
<p>Paul wanted to bring John Mark on another missionary trip, but Barnabas did not want to bring him. They decided to separate and go on separate missionary trips.</p>
<h3 id="paul-and-peter-s-different-missions-gal-2-7-10-">Paul and Peter&#39;s different missions (Gal. 2:7–10)</h3>
<p>Paul thought that the ministry should be focused on the gentiles, but Peter wanted to focus on the Jews. The apostles recognized the ministry of Paul and agreed to send them to preach to the gentiles.</p>
<h3 id="euodia-and-syntyche-s-conflict-phil-4-2-3-">Euodia and Syntyche&#39;s conflict (Phil. 4:2–3)</h3>
<p>We don&#39;t know exactly why these two women were fighting, but Paul encouraged them to be of the same mind in the Lord.</p>

<h1 id="our-response-to-leadership">Our response to leadership</h1>
<h2 id="leaders-are-established-by-god">Leaders are established by God</h2>
<p>Daniel 2:21 teaches that God is the one who establishes government leaders in this world. There is no authority, unless it comes from God (Rom. 13:1–2). God is the one who has given leaders to the church to help us grow in Christ (Eph. 4:11).</p>
<h2 id="do-not-blindly-follow-all-leaders">Do not blindly follow all leaders</h2>
<p>We should not automatically follow every leader in the church. They are human, as we are, and so can make mistakes, be deceived, or sin. We need to be careful that we are not like blind men being lead by other blind men (Matt. 15:14). We need to examine the lives and teaching of leaders to see if they are worthy of following.</p>
<p>The Jews in Berea did not at first believe everything that Paul said, but they went home and searched the Old Testament to see if the things he said were true (Acts 17:11). Because there are many false prophets in the world, we need to test the spirits (1 John 4:1). Jesus said that they way we will know if someone is a true prophet is by their fruit (Matt. 7:15–16).</p>
<p>Sometimes we can learn from leaders even when they are not perfect. Jesus told the people to listen to the teaching of the Pharisees, but not to follow their actions because they did not do what they preached (Matt. 23:3).</p>
<h2 id="respect-leaders-for-the-work-that-they-do">Respect leaders for the work that they do</h2>
<p>We respect leaders because of the work that they do and not because they are more special than us (1 Thess. 5:12–13; 1 Cor. 16:15–18).</p>
<p>They are giving their time and energy to help us. They will have to give an account to God about how they were leaders to us. We make their job easier when we listen to them (Heb. 13:17).</p>
<h2 id="respect-those-that-are-older-than-you">Respect those that are older than you</h2>
<p>The elders in the church have experience from life. We need to respect them and learn from them (1 Tim. 5:1–2).</p>
<p>While the younger do need to respect the elder, all of us need to respect each other (1 Pet. 5:5).</p>
