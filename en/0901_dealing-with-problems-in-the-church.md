# Dealing with problems in the church

Circumcision of Gentiles and the Jerusalem meeting.

### Communication/listening

---

1 Timothy 5:19–20 (KJV 1900)
19Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.
20Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.

1 Timothy 5:22 (KJV 1900)
22Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.

Jesus on dealing with someone who you think is doing wrong.

The log in your eye.

Paul in Romans on dealing with differences.

### No jealousy of other workers

Being a follower of Paul or Apollos or Cephas.

> 1 Co 3:3–11 (TNIV)
> 3You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere human beings? 4For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere human beings?
> 5What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task. 6 I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow. 7So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. 8The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor. 9For we are God’s co-workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.
> 10By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care. 11For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.

> 1 Co 3:21–23 (TNIV)
> 21 So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours, 22whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours, 23and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.

What about so many divisions in the church? Should we always start new churches or can we join with others?
