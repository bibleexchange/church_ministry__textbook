# Dealing with problems in the church

## Councils in Jerusalem

There are three times in the book of Acts when the apostles and elders met together in Jerusalem. All three of them were about ministry among the gentiles:

1. Acts 11:1-18: After Peter went to the house of Cornelius, they discussed if gentiles could be baptized.
2. Acts 15:1-35: They discussed if gentile converts needed to be circumcised and follow the Mosaic Law.
3. Acts 21:17-26: They discussed Paul's ministry to the gentiles.

We see from these councils, that when there was a question of doctrine in the church, the leaders all met together to agree about the right answer. This was continued in church history with councils like the ones at Nicea (325 AD), Ephesus (431 AD), and Chalcedon (451 AD). As time continued and there became many divisions in the church, these universal councils stopped, but there have recently been efforts to unite Christians across different organizations, such as the World Council of Churches.

## We need humility when trying to fix problems

The log in your eye:

Matthew 7:1–5 (KJV 1900)
1Judge not, that ye be not judged.
2For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.
3And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
4Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?
5Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.

## Communication/listening

1 Timothy 5:19–20 (KJV 1900)
19 Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.
20 Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.

Dealing with divisive people:

> Titus 3:10-11 (ESV)
> "As for a person who stirs up division, after warning him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him, knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned."

Jesus on dealing with someone who you think is doing wrong:

> Matthew 18:15-17 (ESV)
> "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector."

Handling those who are disobedient:

> 2 Thessalonians 3:14-15 (ESV)
> "If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person, and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed. Do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother."

Fixing the problems in the church instead of going to the civic government.

<!-- I think I need to study this more before including
Addressing serious sin in the congregation:

> 1 Corinthians 5:1-13 (ESV)
> "It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you... When you are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus... you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord."-->

<!--
1 Timothy 5:22 (KJV 1900)
22 Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.-->

## We need to know what things are important enough to separate about

Paul in Romans on dealing with differences. A good example is that Paul circumcised Timothy, even though he did not think it was necessary. Acts 16:1-3. Paul on circumcision: Gal. 5:6

What about so many divisions in the church? Should we always start new churches or can we join with others?

There are clearly many verses that say to separate from Christians who are sinning or purposely leading people away from the truth.

1 Corinthians 5:11 (ESV)
"But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people."

Romans 16:17-18 (ESV)
"I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them. For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people."

2 Thessalonians 3:6 (ESV)
"In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers and sisters, to keep away from every believer who is idle and disruptive and does not live according to the teaching you received from us."

2 Thessalonians 3:14-15 (ESV)
"Take special note of anyone who does not obey our instruction in this letter. Do not associate with them, in order that they may feel ashamed. Yet do not regard them as an enemy, but warn them as a fellow believer."

2 John 1:9-11 (ESV)
"Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take them into your house or welcome them. Anyone who welcomes them shares in their wicked work."

1 Timothy 6:3-5 (ESV)
"If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching, they are conceited and understand nothing... Have nothing to do with such people."

2 Timothy 3:5 (ESV)
"...having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people."

## No jealousy of other workers

This is not a good reason to separate. As we see in church history, many divisions in the church are not actually about doctrine, but about power.

Being a follower of Paul or Apollos or Cephas.

> 1 Corinthians 1:10–17 (TNIV)
> 10I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.
> 11My brothers and sisters, some from Chloe’s household have informed me that there are quarrels among you.
> 12What I mean is this: One of you says, “I follow Paul”; another, “I follow Apollos”; another, “I follow Cephas”; still another, “I follow Christ.”
> 13Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized into the name of Paul?
> 14I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,
> 15so no one can say that you were baptized into my name.
> 16(Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don’t remember if I baptized anyone else.)
> 17For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.

> 1 Co 3:3–11 (TNIV)
> 3You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere human beings? 4For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere human beings?
> 5What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task. 6 I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow. 7So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. 8The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor. 9For we are God’s co-workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.
> 10By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care. 11For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.

> 1 Co 3:21–23 (TNIV)
> 21 So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours, 22whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours, 23and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.

## We need to allow those who repent back into the church

Restoring those who fall:

> Galatians 6:1 (ESV)
> "Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted."

Bringing back those who wander:

> James 5:19-20 (ESV)
> "My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back, let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins."

## Disputes in the New Testament

Dispute Over Food Sacrificed to Idols (1 Corinthians 8-10):

> Some Corinthian believers thought eating food sacrificed to idols was acceptable, while others considered it sinful. Paul solved this by explaining that while idols are nothing, believers should consider how their actions affect others with weaker consciences and voluntarily limit their freedom for others' sake.
> Claude.ai (obviously don't quote this exactly)

Peter's Inconsistent Behavior (Galatians 2:11-14):

> Paul confronted Peter (Cephas) publicly when Peter stopped eating with Gentile believers after certain Jews arrived. Paul addressed this hypocrisy directly, emphasizing that justification comes through faith in Christ, not by observing the law.
> Claude.ai (obviously don't quote this exactly)

Paul and Barnabas disagreed about Timothy:

> Acts 15:36-41 (ESV)
> Paul and Barnabas disagreed sharply about whether to take John Mark on their second missionary journey. Barnabas wanted to give Mark another chance after he had abandoned them previously, while Paul refused. Their solution was to separate: Barnabas took Mark to Cyprus, and Paul chose Silas as his new partner. Despite their disagreement, both continued their missionary work.

Paul and Peter's Different Missions (Galatians 2:7-10):

> There was potential for conflict between the ministries of Paul and Peter, but they resolved this by recognizing their different callings: "they recognized that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised." They shook hands in partnership while maintaining their distinct mission fields, showing how ministry differences can be handled through mutual respect and recognition.
> Claude.ai (obviously don't quote this exactly)

Euodia and Syntyche's Conflict (Philippians 4:2-3):

> Paul addresses a personal conflict between two women in the Philippian church: "I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord." He asks a person called "loyal yokefellow" to help these women resolve their differences, noting that both had "contended at my side in the cause of the gospel." This shows Paul's concern for unity and his approach of enlisting others to help mediate personal conflicts.
> Claude.ai (obviously don't quote this exactly)
