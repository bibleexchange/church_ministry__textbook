# Dealing with problems in the church

## Councils in Jerusalem

There are three times in the book of Acts when the apostles and elders met together in Jerusalem. All three of them were about ministry among the gentiles:

1. Acts 11:1-18: After Peter went to the house of Cornelius, they discussed if gentiles could be baptized.
2. Acts 15:1-35: They discussed if gentile converts needed to be circumcised and follow the Mosaic Law.
3. Acts 21:17-26: They discussed Paul's ministry to the gentiles.

We see from these councils, that when there was a question of doctrine in the church, the leaders all met together to agree about the right answer. This was continued in church history with councils like the ones at Nicea (325 AD), Ephesus (431 AD), and Chalcedon (451 AD). As time continued and there became many divisions in the church, these universal councils stopped, but there have recently been efforts to unite Christians across different organizations, such as the World Council of Churches.

## We need humility when trying to fix problems

In Matthew 7:1–5, Jesus teaches us about judging others. We need to be very careful when judging others, because we might also have the sin in our lives. We need to make sure that we remain humble and recognize our human weakness to sin.

## We need to listen before we judge others

In Matthew 18:15-17, Jesus gives three steps for correcting someone in the church:

1. Go to them by yourself
2. If they do not listen, go again with one or two elders
3. If he still does not listen, tell the church about the sinner

We should not listen to an accusation against an elder unless there are two or three witnesses that make the same accusation (1 Tim. 5:19–20).

Paul says that if someone is causing division in the church, you should warn them twice before removing them from the church (Titus 3:10-11).

The sins that Paul are most concerned about are the sins that would cause division in the church:

1. Disobedience (2 Thess. 3:6; 3:14-15)
2. False teaching (Rom. 16:17-18; 1 Tim. 6:3-5; 2 Tim. 3:5; 2 John 1:9-11)

Besides these, 1 Corinthians 5:11 also lists sexually immorality, greed, idolatry, slandering, drunkenness, and swindling.

When possible, when there are problems between two people in the church, that problem should be solved inside the church instead of going to the civic government (1 Cor. 6:1-8).

<!-- I think I need to study this more before including
Addressing serious sin in the congregation:

> 1 Corinthians 5:1-13 (ESV)
> "It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you... When you are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus... you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord."-->

## We need to know what things are important enough to separate about

We see that there are times to separate from other Christians, but how do we know exactly when to separate?

Paul teaches in Romans chapter 14 about how to handle differences of beliefs between Christians. Some Christians did not want to eat meat that had been offered to idols, but other Christians knew that the idol was not real, so there was no sin in eating the meat. There was also debate about holy days. Some Christians wanted to keep holy days, but others felt that all days were the same. Paul told them not to judge each other on these things (Rom. 14:10-13). All people did what they did for the glory of God (Rom. 14:6).

Paul also says that we should be careful not to offend other Christians who believe differently than we do. If someone does not believe in eating meat offered to idols, then we should not eat the meat when they are around (Rom. 14:20-21. See also 1 Cor. 8:1-13 and 10:23-33.).

A good example of doing things to not offend other believers is when Paul circumcised Timothy in Acts 16:1-3. Paul did not believe that circumcision was needed for salvation (Gal. 5:6), but he still circumcised Timothy so that other believers would be ready to listen to him.

There are some things from this we can do to keep our heart right when dealing with differences:

1. Everyone should be fully convinced in their own mind of what is right (Rom. 14:5)
2. Whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God (Rom. 14:22)
3. Make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification (Rom. 14:19)

## No jealousy of other workers

As we see in church history, many divisions in the church are not actually about doctrine, but about power. People disagree about who should be the leader and so they separate. This is not a good reason to separate.

We see this in the early church. Some Christians were creating groups around the teachings of certain church leaders. Some joined to Paul, others to Apollos, and others to Cephas. Paul corrected this thinking by reminding them that only Jesus is worthy of our allegiance, since only Jesus died for us and we are baptized in the name of Jesus and not in the name of any human (1 Cor. 1:10–17).

These leaders are only servants of God. We each do different things in the Kingdom of God, but it is only God that brings real spiritual change (1 Cor. 3:3–11, 21–23).

Why do we have so many divisions in the church? If we go to a village and want to start a church, we should think about what churches are already in that village. If we are Pentecostal and there is already a Pentecostal church in that village of a different organization, we should consider going to that church and helping them instead of starting a new church.

## We need to allow those who repent back into the church

1. If someone sins, we should try to help restore them (Gal. 6:1)
2. If someone wanders from the truth, we should try to bring them back (James 5:19-20)

We should be careful not to be very hard to those that have sinned. We should forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow (2 Cor.s 2:5–8).

<!--Note here in 2 Corinthians 2:5–8, that there is some kind of vote to decide about punishing someone-->

## Disputes in the New Testament

There are some times in the New Testament when people disagreed. We cannot make doctrine out of how they solved these issues, but we can learn wisdom in the decisions that they made.

### Peter's inconsistent behavior (Gal. 2:11-14)

Paul confronted Peter (Cephas) publicly when Peter stopped eating with Gentile believers after certain Jews arrived. Paul addressed this hypocrisy directly, emphasizing that justification comes through faith in Christ, not by observing the law.

### Paul and Barnabas disagreed about John Mark (Acts 15:36-41)

Paul wanted to bring John Mark on another missionary trip, but Barnabas did not want to bring him. They decided to separate and go on separate missionary trips.

### Paul and Peter's different missions (Gal. 2:7-10)

Paul thought that the ministry should be focused on the gentiles, but Peter wanted to focus on the Jews. The apostles recognized the ministry of Paul and agreed to send them to preach to the gentiles.

### Euodia and Syntyche's conflict (Phil. 4:2-3)

We don't know exactly why these two women were fighting, but Paul encouraged them to be of the same mind in the Lord.
