# Dealing with problems in the church

Circumcision of Gentiles and the Jerusalem meeting.

### Communication/listening

1 Timothy 5:19–20 (KJV 1900)
19 Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.
20 Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.

1 Timothy 5:22 (KJV 1900)
22 Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.

Jesus on dealing with someone who you think is doing wrong:

> Matthew 18:15-17 (ESV)
> "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector."

Addressing serious sin in the congregation:

> 1 Corinthians 5:1-13 (ESV)
> "It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you... When you are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus... you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord."

Fixing the problems in the church instead of going to the civic government.

The log in your eye.

Paul in Romans on dealing with differences. A good example is that Paul circumcised Timothy, even though he did not think it was necessary.

Restoring those who fall:

> Galatians 6:1 (ESV)
> "Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted."

Bringing back those who wander:

> James 5:19-20 (ESV)
> "My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back, let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins."

Handling those who are disobedient:

> 2 Thessalonians 3:14-15 (ESV)
> "If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person, and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed. Do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother."

Dealing with divisive people:

> Titus 3:10-11 (ESV)
> "As for a person who stirs up division, after warning him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him, knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned."

### No jealousy of other workers

Being a follower of Paul or Apollos or Cephas.

> 1 Corinthians 1:10–17 (TNIV)
> 10I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.
> 11My brothers and sisters, some from Chloe’s household have informed me that there are quarrels among you.
> 12What I mean is this: One of you says, “I follow Paul”; another, “I follow Apollos”; another, “I follow Cephas”; still another, “I follow Christ.”
> 13Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized into the name of Paul?
> 14I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,
> 15so no one can say that you were baptized into my name.
> 16(Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don’t remember if I baptized anyone else.)
> 17For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.

> 1 Co 3:3–11 (TNIV)
> 3You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere human beings? 4For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere human beings?
> 5What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task. 6 I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow. 7So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. 8The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor. 9For we are God’s co-workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.
> 10By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care. 11For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.

> 1 Co 3:21–23 (TNIV)
> 21 So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours, 22whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours, 23and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.

## Disputes in the New Testament

Dispute Over Food Sacrificed to Idols (1 Corinthians 8-10):

> Some Corinthian believers thought eating food sacrificed to idols was acceptable, while others considered it sinful. Paul solved this by explaining that while idols are nothing, believers should consider how their actions affect others with weaker consciences and voluntarily limit their freedom for others' sake.
> Claude.ai (obviously don't quote this exactly)

Peter's Inconsistent Behavior (Galatians 2:11-14):

> Paul confronted Peter (Cephas) publicly when Peter stopped eating with Gentile believers after certain Jews arrived. Paul addressed this hypocrisy directly, emphasizing that justification comes through faith in Christ, not by observing the law.
> Claude.ai (obviously don't quote this exactly)

Paul and Barnabas disagreed about Timothy:

> Acts 15:36-41 (ESV)
> Paul and Barnabas disagreed sharply about whether to take John Mark on their second missionary journey. Barnabas wanted to give Mark another chance after he had abandoned them previously, while Paul refused. Their solution was to separate: Barnabas took Mark to Cyprus, and Paul chose Silas as his new partner. Despite their disagreement, both continued their missionary work.

Paul and Peter's Different Missions (Galatians 2:7-10):

> There was potential for conflict between the ministries of Paul and Peter, but they resolved this by recognizing their different callings: "they recognized that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised." They shook hands in partnership while maintaining their distinct mission fields, showing how ministry differences can be handled through mutual respect and recognition.
> Claude.ai (obviously don't quote this exactly)

Euodia and Syntyche's Conflict (Philippians 4:2-3):

> Paul addresses a personal conflict between two women in the Philippian church: "I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord." He asks a person called "loyal yokefellow" to help these women resolve their differences, noting that both had "contended at my side in the cause of the gospel." This shows Paul's concern for unity and his approach of enlisting others to help mediate personal conflicts.
> Claude.ai (obviously don't quote this exactly)

What about so many divisions in the church? Should we always start new churches or can we join with others?
