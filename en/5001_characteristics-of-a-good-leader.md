# Characteristics of a good leader

Or, how to choose leaders in the church?

The process of some people being chosen as leaders:

- Mathias
- Paul and Barnabas being sent
- Jesus calling the disciples
- The caul of Paul: was first taught, vision, submitted to others for baptism, learned in the wilderness

## Character

All preachers can say they are called of God, but how do we know if they will really be a good leader in the church? We already said before that what makes a good leader in worldly things is not what will make a good leader in spiritual things.

We should not just look for someone who has a strong personality or is a "powerful" preacher. We need to look at how they live their lives. Jesus said we would know a tree by its fruit.

The only "ministry" ability in the list is that the overseers and elders should be able to teach.

These things are not things special for only leaders, but they are expected of all Christians. The leader is supposed to be an example of these characteristics.

We will not go over every point, but we will combine these lists together and highlight a few things that are repeated among them.

1 Timothy 3:1-13
1 This is a true saying, if a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.
2 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;
3 Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;
4 One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;
5 (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
6 Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
7 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
8 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;
9 Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
10 And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.
11 Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.
12 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
13 For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.

Titus 1:5-9
5 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:
6 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
7 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
8 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
9 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.

Acts 6:3
3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.

Didache 15:1-2
1 APPOINT therefore for yourselves bishops and deacons worthy of the Lord, meek men, and not lovers of money, and truthful and approved, for they also minister to you the ministry of the prophets and teachers.
2 Therefore do not despise them, for they are your honourable men together with the prophets and teachers.

### Temperate

> Second, the overseer must be “temperate” (3:11, Titus 2:2). The question is whether the term is to be taken as a literal reference to the virtue of moderation in the use of wine (3:3, 8; Titus 2:2, 3), or rather as a figurative reference to balanced, sober thinking.48 The unequivocal reference to literal sobriety in 3:3 suggests the moral sense of being balanced in thought here. The overseer is to maintain command of his reason, to be watchful and observant of things going on around him, and balanced in his assessments.

### Self control

> Third, “self-control” (see 2:9 Excursus) is required of the overseer. One of the cardinal virtues in Greco-Roman ethical thought, it was appropriated by Hellenistic Judaism and supplied with a theological basis in the Torah (see on Titus 1:8). Paul deepened this basis by linking it to the Christ event (Titus 2:12). The term covers a range of meaning (prudence, moderation, sobriety), but gives the general sense of control over the behavior and the impulses and emotions beneath it. Although it appears here as a requirement for leadership (Titus 1:8), it was expected of all believers (2:9, 15; Titus 2:2, 4, 5, 6).
> Towner, P. H. (2006). The Letters to Timothy and Titus (pp. 251–252). Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

### Not angry

### Not greedy for money

This same things is said for bishops, deacons, and elders.

We will talk more about leaders and money later.

### Must take good care of his family

If he cannot take care of his family, how can he take care of the church?

### Hospitable

Romans 12:13 (KJV 1900)
13Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.

Hebrews 13:2 (KJV 1900)
2Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.

1 Peter 4:9 (KJV 1900)
9Use hospitality one to another without grudging.

> Given the dangers of travel in the empire and the economic uncertainties faced by many believers, the early Christian mission and churches depended upon those who would open their homes and share their goods.  
> Towner, P. H. (2006). The Letters to Timothy and Titus (p. 252). Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

### Humility

Not listed in any of the qualification lists, but part of the teaching of Jesus.

## Good leader in the home

## Age

1 Tim 3:6 says that a bishop cannot be a novice, but those that mean they must be a certain age?

> 1 Timothy 4:12
> 12 Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.

<!--Use of the title "elder." Older women teach the younger-->

## Marital status

Does someone have to be married to be a worker in the church? See 1 Tim. 3:2

> Paul could have said clearly (1) “Must be married,” (2) “Not polygamous,” (3) “Faithful to his wife,” or (4) “Not remarried/divorced.”
> Mounce, W. D. (2000). Pastoral Epistles (Vol. 46, p. 170). Word, Incorporated.

### Possible meaning 1: Must be married

#### Paul was not married

> 1 Corinthians 7:8 (KJV 1900)
> 8 I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.

Some people said Paul could not be an apostle because he wasn't married:

> 1 Corinthians 9:5 (KJV 1900)
> 5 Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?

##### Some people choose not to be married for the kingdom of God

> 1 Corinthians 7:25–28 (TNIV)
> 25 Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy.
> 26 Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is.
> 27 Are you pledged to a woman? Do not seek to be released. Are you free from such a commitment? Do not look for a wife.
> 28 But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this.

> 1 Corinthians 7:32-35
> 33 But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.
> 34 There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
> 35 And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.

> Matthew 19:3-12
> 3 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
> 4 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,
> 5 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?
> 6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
> 7 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?
> 8 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.
> 9 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.
> 10 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.
> 11 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.
> 12 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.

Marriage is not a sin. It can even be a good thing. But it can limit your time, resources, and ability to move about.

#### Possible meaning 2: Not polygamous

#### Possible meaning 3: Faithful to his wife

#### Possible meaning 4: Not remarried/divorced

> The opposition to second marriage became very strong in the latter part of the second century. It was elevated into an article of faith by the Montanists, and was emphasised by Tertullian, and by Athenagoras, who called second marriage “a specious adultery”
> Vincent, M. R. (1887). Word studies in the New Testament (Vol. 4, p. 229). Charles Scribner’s Sons.

> We have already said, that a bishop, a presbyter, and a deacon, when they are constituted, must be but once married, whether their wives be alive or whether they be dead; and that it is not lawful for them, if they are unmarried when they are ordained, to be married afterwards; or if they be then married, to marry a second time, but to be content with that wife, which they had when they came to ordination. We also appoint that the ministers, and singers, and readers, and porters, shall be only once married. But if they entered into the clergy before they were married, we permit them to marry, if they have an inclination thereto, lest they sin and incur punishment. But we do not permit any one of the clergy to take to wife either a courtesan, or a servant, or a widow, or one that is divorced, as also the law says. (6.3.17; ANF 7:457)
> Mounce, W. D. (2000). Pastoral Epistles (Vol. 46, p. 191). Word, Incorporated.

#### Conclusion to marriage status

There is probably a little bit of 2, 3, and 4 meant here.

> The phrase translated “faithful to his wife” (TNIV) is literally “husband of one wife” (Titus 1:6). But the NIV had “the husband of but one wife” and the NRSV has “married only once,” so the ambiguity of the phrase is evident. Was it meant to rule out polygamists,38 or to exclude unmarried men from holding the office? Did it intend to prohibit remarriage, either after the death of a spouse,40 or after a divorce? Various considerations make these specific interpretations less than likely,42 and the broader interests of the passage suggest that fidelity in marriage (understood to be monogamous and acceptable in the eyes of the community) is meant.

## Gender

Does a leader have to be a man?

In the Bible, there are many women who work for God. In the Old Testament:

- Miriam (Exodus 15:20)
- Deborah (Judges 4:4)
- Huldah (2 Kings 22:14; 2 Chronicles 34:22)
- The wife of Isaiah (Isaiah 8:3)
- Sons and daughters will prophesy (Joel 2:28-29)

In the New Testament:

- Elisabeth (Luke 1:41-42)
- Mary Mother of Jesus (Luke 1:46–55)
- Anna (Luke 2:36-38)
- Unnamed patrons (mfazili) of Jesus (Luke 8:1–3)
- Women followers of Jesus (Mark 15:40–41)
- Mary Magdalene (John 20:18)
- Tabitha (Acts 9:36)
- Lydia (Acts 16:14)
- Priscilla (Acts 18:26)
- Philip's daughters (Acts 21:9)
- Pheobe (Romans 16:1)
- Junia (Romans 16:7)
- Mother of Rufus (Romans 16:13)
- Mary, Tryphaena, Tryphosa, and Persis “who has worked hard in the Lord” (Romans 16:6, 12)
- Euodia and Syntyche (Philippians 4:2–3)
- Lois and Eunice (2 Timothy 1:5)
- Older women train the younger (Titus 2:3–5)

Besides these, Jesus had deep theological conversations with women.

### Then why does Paul say not to let women teach in the church?

> 1 Timothy 2:11–12 (KJV 1900)
> 11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
> 12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.

> 1 Corinthians 14:34–35 (KJV 1900)
> 34 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.
> 35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.

No matter what you decide, you have to find a way to reconcile these passages of Paul with the fact that so many women ministered in the early church.

It is possible that Paul was dealing with specific issues of the churches he was writing to and not overall commands to the church at large.

#### Possible explanations

These are some of the most difficult passages in the Bible and many intelligent scholars come to different answers on both sides.

1. These are commands for the whole church for all time and women should not be allowed to speak in the church.
2. Paul was trying to fix specific problems with women (perhaps being false teachers) in these churches (Corinth and Ephesus) and they are not universial prohibitions.
3. Paul was speaking in cultural contexts and was trying to adopt to them.

- Women might have been uneducated and disrupting the church.
- "The law" was not Jewish, but Roman. And here it should be translated husband and wife instead of man and woman.

4. Paul was speaking of his own idea and not an idea directly from God. (1 Tim. 1:12. See 1 Cor. 7:25)

At the far ends of this debate are people who say women should do nothing at all in the church (such as the medieval church that banned congregational singing so that women would not sing) and those who see absolutely no difference bewteen man and women in ministry. Most people fall somewhere between these two poles. Some say women cannot preach, but will let women sing and testify. Some believe women can be preachers, but not pastors or bishops.
