# Our response to leadership

## Leaders are established by God

Daniel 2:21 teaches that God is the one who establishes government leaders in this world. There is no authority, unless it comes from God (Rom. 13:1–2). God is the one who has given leaders to the church to help us grow in Christ (Eph. 4:11).

## Do not blindly follow all leaders

We should not automatically follow every leader in the church. They are human, as we are, and so can make mistakes, be deceived, or sin. We need to be careful that we are not like blind men being lead by other blind men (Matt. 15:14). We need to examine the lives and teaching of leaders to see if they are worthy of following.

The Jews in Berea did not at first believe everything that Paul said, but they went home and searched the Old Testament to see if the things he said were true (Acts 17:11). Because there are many false prophets in the world, we need to test the spirits (1 John 4:1). Jesus said that they way we will know if someone is a true prophet is by their fruit (Matt. 7:15–16).

Sometimes we can learn from leaders even when they are not perfect. Jesus told the people to listen to the teaching of the Pharisees, but not to follow their actions because they did not do what they preached (Matt. 23:3).

## Respect leaders for the work that they do

We respect leaders because of the work that they do and not because they are more special than us (1 Thess. 5:12–13; 1 Cor. 16:15–18).

They are giving their time and energy to help us. They will have to give an account to God about how they were leaders to us. We make their job easier when we listen to them (Heb. 13:17).

## Respect those that are older than you

The elders in the church have experience from life. We need to respect them and learn from them (1 Tim. 5:1–2).

While the younger do need to respect the elder, all of us need to respect each other (1 Pet. 5:5).
