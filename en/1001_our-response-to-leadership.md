# Our response to leadership

Add some general thoughts about secular leaders from Romans 13.

What to do when you are not the leader.

Jesus said to listen to those who even do not practice what they preach:

> Matthew 23:3 (ESV)
> So do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do. For they preach, but do not practice.

a plan for leadership and obedience:

Hebrews 13:17 (ESV)
Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.

> 1 Co 16:15–18 (TNIV)
> 15You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the Lord’s people. I urge you, brothers and sisters,
> 16to submit to such as these and to everyone who joins in the work and labors at it.
> 17I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.
> 18For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition.

> 1 Th 5:12–13 (TNIV)
> 12Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you.
> 13Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other.

We respect leaders because of the work that they do and not because they are more special than us.

1 Timothy 5:1–2 (KJV 1900)
1Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;
2The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.

1 Peter 5:5 (KJV 1900)
5Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.

Yes, the younger need to respect the elder, but all of us need to respect each other.
