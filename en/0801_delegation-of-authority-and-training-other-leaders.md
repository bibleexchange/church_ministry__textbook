# Delegation of authority and training others

Some leaders are afraid of sharing the authority with others. They want to have all the power. But the church is a body and is is bigger than any one person. There is no way that one person can fulfill all the work of God.

We see in Exodus a story about Moses. Moses sat all day listening to the problems of the people and doing the work of a judge. He had a relative come to visit, and when the relative saw the work of Moses, he suggested that Moses share that work with others:

> Exodus 18:21 — Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:

## Make disciples of all nations

Before Jesus ascended to heaven, He gave a final commandment to His disciples. He told them to take the Gospel into all the world. The Greek that is used is best translated to "go into all the world and make disciples" (Matt. 28:18–20).

It was always the plan of Jesus to teach disciples, who would then teach other disciples. This process of disciples making more disciples would continue until all the world had the opportunity to become disciples of Jesus. Paul told Timothy to teach people and give them authority to teach others (2 Tim. 2:2).

### Jesus and the twelve

Jesus spent a lot of time teaching the twelve disciples. He took every opportunity that He could to teach them. He taught them while they were walking down the road, when they were in the boat, and when they were sitting at the table to eat food.

He made sure that they were ready to continue His ministry. He sent them out to preach and gave them power to heal sicknesses and cast out demons (Matt. 10:1; Mark 3:13–15).

### Jesus and the seventy

It was not only the twelve that Jesus prepared for ministry, but in Luke 10:1–9, Jesus sent out seventy people to go before Him to the villages to preach and heal people. This was to prepare the people to be ready to hear the message of Jesus. He gave them complete authority to speak on His behalf (Luke 10:16).

### Elders and the younger

Those that are elders in the church should train those that are younger (Titus 2:3–4).

Paul trained Timothy in spiritual things. He became a spiritual father to him. He gave Timothy authority to continue the work that he started.

1. Paul took Timothy to work with him in ministry (Phil. 2:22)
2. Paul sent Timothy to continue his work (1 Cor. 4:17; 16:10–11)
3. Paul called Timothy his coworker (1 Thess. 3:2–3)
4. Paul left Timothy in Ephesus to try to stop the false teachers (1 Tim. 1:3–4)
5. Paul encouraged Timothy to continue in the work and to not be afraid or let other people stop him (1 Tim. 4:12–14; 2 Tim. 1:6–7; 2:1–2; 3:14–15)

## Appointing church leaders

It is true that it is God who calls people to ministry and gives them spiritual gifts to do that work, but it helps the church when we officially recognize leaders as being sent by God.

1. Paul appointed leaders in the churches as he traveled (Acts 14:23)
2. Paul left Titus in Crete so that he could appoint elders in the churches (Titus 1:5)

### We see sometimes when this appointment was made by the group of elders

This was not just the decision of one leader to choose other leaders, but all the leaders in a church were to be in agreement:

1. Timothy received his gift when the elders laid hands on him (1 Tim. 4:14 )
2. Paul was sent on his first missionary trip after the elders in Antioch laid hands on him and prayed for him (Acts 13:1–3)

### People should be tested before being made leaders

We should not be quick to choose leaders in the church (1 Tim. 5:22), but we should test them to make sure that they will be good leaders (1 Tim. 3:10).

This is why Paul gave lists for the qualification of leaders in 1 Timothy chapter three and Titus chapter one.

## Sending by the church

Sometimes the church would chose to send someone to do a specific task.

1. Judas and Silas were sent with a letter from the elders (Acts 15:22–27). After reading the letter, Judas and Silas exhorted more about what the meaning of the letter was (Acts 15:32).
2. Titus and an unnamed brother were sent by the church to bring the collection to Jerusalem (2 Cor. 8:16–19).
3. The Philippian church sent Epaphroditus to help Paul (Philippians 2:25).
4. The church in Jerusalem sent Peter and John to Samaria to help Philip (Acts 8:14).
5. The church in Jerusalem sent Barnabas to Antioch to evangelize (Acts 11:22).

## The process of some people being chosen as leaders

### The disciples

Jesus called most of His disciples in a similar way. They were doing their normal work, Jesus came by and simply called for them to follow, and they left what they were doing to follow Him.

1. Peter and Andrew (Matt. 4:18–20)
2. James and John the sons of Zebedee (Matt. 4:21–22)
3. Philip (John 1:43–44)
4. Nathanael, also known as Bartholomew (John 1:45–49)
5. Matthew, also known as Levi (Matt. 9:9; Mark 2:14)
6. Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, Judas son of James, also known as Thaddaeus. We have no record of them being called, but we wee them listed among the other disciples in Luke 6:12–16.
7. Judas Iscariot. We do not have record of how he was called, but Jesus says that he was called (John 6:70–71).

### Mathias (Acts 1:23–26)

The apostles wanted to chose someone to take the place of Judas Iscariot after he killed himself. There were two men that they thought would be good to replace Judas: Joseph or Matthias. But how would they choose which one? First, they prayed to God to show them. That is not surprising. What is surprising is that they next write the names of the two men on paper and randomly choose one. They believed that it was not really random, but that God would guide their hand to make the correct choice. This is the only time in the New Testament where we see a leader chosen in this way, but this process was used other times in the Old testament to make decisions.

### Helpers that feed the widows (Acts 6:1–6)

The Apostles wanted to find seven leaders to help serve food to the widows. They chose men who were honest, full of the Holy Spirit, and full of wisdom. After they chose the men, they prayed and laid their hands on them.

### Paul

1. Paul was called by Jesus (Acts 9:3–6)
2. He was baptized by Ananias (Acts 9:17–18)
3. He immediately started preaching (Acts 9:20–21)
4. Later, the elders in Antioch laid hands on him and sent him on his first missionary trip (Acts 13:1–3)

<!--Need to deal with the differences in Galatians-->

<!--## The removal of leaders

Does this mean that a leader is always a leader, even if he sins? Does it mean that if someone is a pastor that they are always a pastor? (I think not)

Romans 11:29 (KJV 1900)
29For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

1 Timothy 5:19–20:
"Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may take warning."
