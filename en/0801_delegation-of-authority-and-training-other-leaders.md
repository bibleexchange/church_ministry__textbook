# Delegation of authority and training others

Or, how to choose leaders in the church?

Some leaders are afraid of sharing the authority with others.

The work is bigger than any one person.

## Moses choosing leaders to help him

> Exodus 18:21  
> 21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:

## Make disciples of all nations

Matthew 28:18–20 (TNIV)
18 Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

It was always the plan of Jesus to teach disciples, who would then teach other disciples. This process of disciples making more disciples would continue until all the world had the opportunity to become disciples of Jesus. Paul told Timothy to teach people and give them authority to teach others (2 Timothy 2:2).

Jesus and the 12:

Mark 3:13-15:
"Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him. He appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach and to have authority to drive out demons."

Matthew 10:1, 5-7:
"Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness... These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: 'Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. As you go, proclaim this message: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.'"

and 70:

Luke 10:1-3:
"After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go. He told them, 'The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.'"

Luke 10:9:
"Heal the sick who are there and tell them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'"

## Appointing church leaders

Acts 14:23 (KJV 1900)
23 And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.

Titus 1:5 (KJV 1900)
5For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:

### We see sometimes when this appointment was made by the group of elders

1 Timothy 4:14 (KJV 1900)
14 Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.

Acts 13:1-3 (First Missionary Journey):
"Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul. While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, 'Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.' So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off."

### People should be tested before being made leaders

1 Timothy 3:10 (TNIV)
10 They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.

This is why Paul gave lists for the qualification of leaders in 1 Timothy chapter three and Titus chapter one.

## Older teach the younger

Titus 2:3–4 (KJV 1900)
3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;
4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,

Paul training Timothy

## Sending by the church

Sometimes the church would chose to send someone to do a specific task.

Acts 15:22-27 (Judas and Silas):
"Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, men who were leaders among the believers... With them they sent the following letter..."

2 Corinthians 8:18-19 (Unnamed brother with Titus):
"And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel. What is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering..."

Philippians 2:25 (Epaphroditus):
"But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, co-worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs."

Acts 8:14 (Peter and John):
"When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to Samaria."

Acts 11:22 (Barnabas):
"News of this reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch."

## The process of some people being chosen as leaders:

- Mathias
- Jesus calling the disciples
- The caul of Paul: was first taught, vision, submitted to others for baptism, learned in the wilderness
- The helpers in Acts 6

<!--
1 Timothy 5:22 (KJV 1900)
22 Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.-->
