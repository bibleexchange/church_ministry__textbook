# Symbols of the church

We do not have any place in the New Testament that explains exactly what the church is and how it is supposed to function. What we do have are symbols that help us understand what the church is supposed to be.

## The body

In the church, there is not one human leader who is more important than all other people in the church. In the New Testament, we do not have a description of exactly what the day to day operation of the church was meant to be. What we do have is symbols or comparisons to things in the natural world.

One of these symbols is the body.

Each member in the church has a different role to do.

The head of the body is not a human, but Jesus.

The priesthood of all believers (1 Peter 2:9).

### Members of the body of Christ

#### No jealousy of other workers

> 1 Co 3:3–11 (TNIV)
> 3You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere human beings? 4For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere human beings?
> 5What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task. 6 I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow. 7So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. 8The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor. 9For we are God’s co-workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.
> 10By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care. 11For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.

> 1 Co 3:21–23 (TNIV)
> 21 So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours, 22whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours, 23and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.

#### Different types of work in the church

> Acts 6:1-6  
> 6 And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
> 2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.
> 3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
> 4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.
> 5 And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:
> 6 Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.

Even though Stephen was chosen to serve tables, that did not mean that he was of little spiritual power:

> Acts 6:8 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.

#### Different spiritual gifts

Romans 12:5–8 (KJV 1900)
5So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.
6Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
7Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;
8Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.

1 Corinthians 12:28–30 (KJV 1900)
28And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
29Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?
30Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?

## Building

Even though many times we talk about the building as being the church, the church is people and not a building.

We are the temple of the Holy Spirit.

Thus, a symbol of the church is that we are all bricks in a building.
