# Symbols of the church

Before we talk more about the leaders of the church, we need to make sure we understand what the church is. We do not have any place in the New Testament that explains exactly what the church is and how it is supposed to function day to day. What we do have are symbols that help us understand what the church is supposed to be. "What is immediately evident in these images for the church is that they all emphasize the communal aspect of Christian faith and life. This communal emphasis stands in contrast to the individualistic approach of so many of the expressions of Christianity in the modern Western world."<sup>[1]</sup>

<!--talk about the universal unity of the church: Ephesians 4:4–5 and John 17:20–23-->

## The body (1 Cor. 12:12-27; Rom. 12:4-5)

In the church, there is not one human leader who is more important than all other people in the church. The head of the body is not a human, but Jesus (Col. 1:18; Eph. 1:22-23; 5:23, 30). All members of the church, including pastors, bishops, and deacons, make up the body (Col. 1:24).

### We are members of the body of Christ

All members of the body are important (1 Cor. 12:21-25). We don't use every part of the body at all times, but through the day, every part of the body is used, even if we do not think about it.

1 Peter 2:9 teaches us that all believers are part of the priesthood of Christ. There are some people in the church who will have gifts for leading and administration, but that does not mean that they are more spiritual or essential to the church.

All members of the church should be closely joined together and work well together (Eph. 4:15-16).

### Each member has a different work or gift

Each member in the church has a different role to do that cannot be done by someone else, just as the hand cannot do the work of the foot, and nor can the foot do the work of the hand. We have two lists of gifts given in the New Testament:

1. Romans 12:6–8: prophecy, ministry, teaching, exhortation, giving, ruling, and showing mercy.
2. 1 Corinthians 12:28: apostles, prophets, teachers, miracles, healings, helps, governments, and diversities of tongues.

We see that these lists have different gifts in them, but both have prophecy and teaching. We should not take these to be complete lists of gifts that God can give, but just some examples of gifts.

#### Each member will have different gifts

1 Corinthians 12:29–30 makes it clear that some of these gifts will be given to someone, but not all of them. God will not give all the gifts of the spirit to one person, since that would mean that they would be proud and would not depend on other members of the church. Our limitations become our strengths when we learn to work together with people who have different strengths than we have.

#### An example of the gifts being used in the church

An example of how these different gifts work in the church can be found in Acts 6:1-6. The apostles were feeding the widows every day, but they said that they had to stop, so that they could focus on prayer and ministry of the word. They chose seven men to do the work of feeding the widows. These men were "full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom." They were not less important than the apostles, but they had a different work to do.

Later, Stephen "did great wonders and miracles among the people" (Acts 6:8) and was killed because he was preaching about Jesus. Philip went to Samaria and preached the Gospel, healed the sick, and cast out demons (Acts 8:5-13). Both of these men had great spiritual power, but were humble enough to serve tables.

## Temple/Building

Even though many times we talk about the building as being the church, the church is people and not a building. We are the temple of the Holy Spirit. The church building is not the "house of God," but we are the house of God. Thus, a symbol of the church is that we are all bricks in a building:

- "You are God's field, God's building" (1 Cor. 3:9)
- "You yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house" (1 Pet. 2:5)
- "Built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets" (Eph. 2:20-22)
- "The church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth" (1 Tim. 3:15)

Christ is the cornerstone (Matt. 21:42; Mark 12:10-11; Luke 20:17; Acts 4:11; Eph. 2:19-20; 1 Pet. 2:6-7).

## Flock/Sheep (John 10:1-16, Acts 20:28-29, 1 Pet. 5:2-4)

Jesus is the shepherd, and his people are the flock.

## Family/Household

- "The household of God, which is the church" (1 Tim. 3:15)
- Believers as "members of the household of God" (Eph. 2:19)

## Branches (John 15:1-8)

In Romans 11:17-24, Paul uses the metaphor of an olive tree to describe God's people.

## Field/Harvest

The church is portrayed as God's field (1 Cor. 3:9) and workers in his harvest (Matt. 9:37-38).

## Bride of Christ (Eph. 5:25-32; Rev. 19:7-9, 21:2)

Of all the symbols, this is the only one that is singular instead of being a composite or group.
