# Modern church organizational structures

We have studied about the types of leaders in the New Testament church, but what does that mean for us today? How should our churches be organized and how should they operate?

> Ultimately, church [structure] has to do with who runs the church and how. This is the question of authority. Does authority lie with a single officeholder? Does it lie with elected representatives? Or does it lie with the congregation as a whole?  
> Another question that [structure] addresses is that of an individual congregation’s relationship with other congregations. Are congregations connected administratively, within a hierarchy? Are they connected spiritually, part of an interdependent network of mutual submission? Or are they not connected at all?<sup>[1]</sup>

The three types of church organizational structures: Episcopal, Presbyterian, and Congregational. All of these structures agree on some fundamental truths about the church. They all believe that the church is made up of a body of people who are called to love each other and be a light to the world, but they disagree about who makes the decisions about "how" they perform these acts in the world. They all agree that God has given leaders to the church to help them grow up, but they disagree about how exactly they do that.

These three structures are shaped by the political situation at the time the church was initially formed as much as it is of any biblical influence. "Thus the Episcopal system was developed largely when Emperors, Kings, and Queens ruled; the Presbyterian system was developed largely when city and state councils ruled; the Congregational system was developed largely when democratic systems ruled; and Hybrid systems have developed only in the past 100 years or so."<sup>[2]</sup>

<!--There is some inconsistency and overlap in these. Some church might be mostly presbyterian, but have bishops (not with apostolic succession) that step in (and maybe overstep) and push certain issues or agendas or try to "fix" problems-->

<!-- probably need some discussion about the "keys" of heaven as used in Matthew 18:15–20 and Matt. 16:17–19-->

## The three types of church organizational structures

### Episcopal structure

In this structure, the local church will have a pastor, and then there will be bishops over a city or a region. These bishops are under a universal authority, which differs in different organizations. In the Roman Catholic Church, this universal authority is the Pope, the Orthodox church, the universal authority is a group of patriarchs, while in other organizations, the universal authority is an archbishop.

The first time we see it explained was by Ignatius in a letter around the year 110 AD. This was the most common structure from the second century until the Reformation. During the Reformation, there was a move to Presbyterian and Congregational structures. In the last two centuries, there have been Protestant churches that have moved away from the ideas of the Reformation and back to a structure more closely resembling the Catholic Church.

Some of these churches believe in "apostolic succession," which means that Jesus gave power to the apostles before He left this world, then the apostles passed that power down to the next generation of leaders by the laying on of hands. They believe this process has continued since the time of the original apostles.

<!--For much of the written history of institutional Christianity, episcopal government was the only known form of church organization. This changed at the Reformation. Many Protestant churches are now organized by either congregational or presbyterian church polities, both descended from the writings of John Calvin, a Protestant reformer working and writing independently following the break with the Catholic Church precipitated by The Ninety-Five Theses of Martin Luther. However, some people have disputed the episcopal polity before the reformation, such as Aerius of Sebaste in the 4th century.

<!--The orthodox church has multiple leaders in the top position, instead of just one leader, like the pope in the Roman Catholic church. Both are Episcopal. -->

- **Source of authority:** Bishops.
- **Key Scriptures used:** Matthew 16:18; Acts 1:15–26

### Presbyterian structure

It is said that "absolute power corrupts absolutely." The Reformers, like John Calvin, felt that many of the problems in the Catholic Church were because a very few people held all the authority of the church. The two types of structures that came from the Reformation are Presbyterian and Congregational.

In a local Presbyterian church, there is not one pastor that makes all the decisions, but there is a group of elders that work together. This doctrine is called the "plurality of elders." Some of these elders have the ability to teach and preach, but not always all of the elders can. There are then regional groups of elders that rule over the local churches and a "general assembly" that rules over the regional groups of elders.

Presbyterian churches differ from Congregational churches because they believe that it is not enough for each local church to operate on its own, but that there needs to be a universal, visible church (Eph. 4:4–5; John 17:20–23). They believe that this can only happen if there are groups of elders that unite the local churches together.<sup>[3]</sup>

- **Source of authority:** Councils of elders.
- **Key Scriptures used:** Hebrews 13:17; 1 Thessalonians 5:12–13

### Congregational structure

If a church is Congregational, then the local church body acts as a complete organization. One large Congregational organization in America is The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC). In this organization, "each local church is autonomous while cooperating voluntarily with others for the sake of the Gospel."<sup>[4]</sup> They fellowship with other churches in the organization, but no one outside the local church can tell them what to believe or how to operate the church. The local church can leave the organization at anytime, if they want. If other churches feel that a local church has strayed from the doctrine of the organization, they can vote to remove that local church.

Inside the local church, there can be different ways of operating. Some have a single pastor as head who leads the congregation with no one to tell him what to do. Others give all the power to the entire congregation and all decisions will have to be voted upon. When all the congregation has power, it "makes every member responsible for establishing churches, for proclaiming the gospel, and for protecting the gospel faithfulness of a church’s members. Presbyterians and episcopalians make the elders and/or bishops responsible for this work."<sup>>[5]</sup>

- **Source of authority:** Either 1) an individual pastor, or 2) the congregation
- **Key Scriptures used:** Matthew 18:17; 1 Corinthians 5:4; 1 Peter 2:9

<!--Not convinced that this is separate from congregational, so removing for now.
### Connectional polity

Connection is "The principle, basic to The United Methodist Church, that all leaders and congregations are connected in a network of loyalties and commitments that support, yet supersede, local concerns."
https://www.umc.org/en/content/glossary-connection, accessed March 7, 2025

> Here again, roots of a relational understanding of connection can be traced back to John Wesley. The earliest Methodist conferences were not formal organizations but rather gatherings of people that had personal relationships with Wesley. Developing Methodist organization grew out of pre-existing relationships among Wesley and the early Methodist preachers and class leaders.
> https://www.umnews.org/en/news/the-many-meanings-of-connectionalism

> A theological understanding of connectionalism affirms that the true nature of the church must include the bonds among congregations. This view contrasts with a congregational understanding of the church, in which each congregation is by itself fully the church. A belief in connectionalism is connected to beliefs about the unity of the church and the catholicity of the church.

## Which structure is best?

All three of these structures use Scriptures as the reason why the chose their structure. No one of the structures is necessarily more Scriptural that the others. While we may not all agree on the specific structure to use, there are some things essential to all church structures:

1. Leaders are for our good and are to be respected.
2. While there are leaders in the church, they are not the only ones who work for God. The whole church is the priesthood of God.
3. Leadership needs to be held accountable somehow. Either by answering to the congregation, the plurality of elders, or leaders above them.

We see that these structures differ in how the authority is distributed in the church:

1. **Episcopal:** Very few people have authority
2. **Presbyterian:** More people have authority that Episcopal, but fewer than Congregational
3. **Congregational**: The most people have authority

## Examples of how churches are structured in Tanzania

### Tanzania Assemblies of God (TAG)

> Local churches are those that are groups or groups of believers who agree with the beliefs and teachings of TAG, who meet regularly to worship at a specific location they agreed upon and under the leadership of one of the ministers recognized by the Regional Committee, State or the Executive Committee. These churches will have standards or conditions for membership that will be set by the General Council of TAG and will be divided into two categories: young churches and mature churches.<sup>[6]</sup>

### Free Pentecostal Church of Tanzania (FPCT)

> We believe... That each local church under the FPCT has the freedom to govern itself, under a legitimate Council of Elders formed on the basis of the Bible. (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:1–3)<sup>[7]</sup>

### The Anglican Church of Tanzania (ACT)

> The Diocesan General Council is the continuing working arm of the Synod. Its members have been selected by their parishes and voted upon at the Synod. The responsibilities of the General Council include supervising the various Boards and Communities of the diocese and deciding who will serve on them.<sup>[8]</sup>

### The Moravian Church of Tanzania

> On the Provincial level, the Church’s structure is divided into an Executive Committee (EXCOM) made up of the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, the General Secretary, the bishop and fourteen departments. Each of them is led by a secretary. This structure is also present at the district, the regional and the congregational level.<sup>[9]</sup>

> A Bishop of the Moravian Church is consecrated to a special priestly pastoral ministry in the name of and for the whole Unity. The office of Bishop represents the vital unity of the Church and the continuity of the Church's ministry, although the Unity does not place emphasis on any mechanical transmission of the apostolic succession. The office and function of a Bishop is valid throughout the Unity as a whole.  
> Duties of a Bishop of the Moravian Church are, among others, the following:
>
> 1. A Bishop has a special duty of intercession for the Unity, and also for the Church of Christ as a whole.
> 2. Only Bishops have the right to ordain or to consecrate to the various orders of the ministry, but only when commissioned to do so by a Provincial Board or Synod.
