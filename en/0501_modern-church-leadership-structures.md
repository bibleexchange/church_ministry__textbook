## Modern church organizational structures

> Ultimately, church polity has to do with who runs the church and how. This is the question of authority. Does authority lie with a single officeholder? Does it lie with elected representatives? Or does it lie with the congregation as a whole?
> Another question that polity addresses is that of an individual congregation’s relationship with other congregations. Are congregations connected administratively, within a hierarchy? Are they connected spiritually, part of an interdependent network of mutual submission? Or are they not connected at all?

All of these structures agree on some fundamental truths about the church. They all believe that the church is made up of a body of people who are called to love each other and be a light to the world. But they disagree about who makes the decisions about "how" they perform these acts in the world. They all agree that God has given leaders to the church to help them grow up, but they disagree about how exactly they do that.

<!-- It would be good to list Tanzanian churches that follow each of these structures-->
<!--bullet points for each to show main characteristics. Compare to other types of polity so that the differences are understood.-->
<!--There is some inconsistency and overlap in these. Some church might be mostly presbyterian, but have bishops (not with apostolic succession) that step in (and maybe overstep) and push certain issues or agendas or try to "fix" problems-->
<!--Should use Scriptures that each use to justify their position-->
<!--absolute power corrupts absolutely-->
<!-- plurality of elders.-->
<!-- probably need some discussion about the "keys" of heaven as used in Matthew 18:15–20 and Matt. 16:17-19-->

<!--I don't see any one of these as necessarily more Scriptural that the others. Some things essential to all church structures:
1. Leaders are for our good and are to be respected.
2. While there are leaders in the church, they do not hold all the power. The whole church is the priesthood of God.
3. Leadership needs to be held accountable somehow. Either by answering to the congregation or plurality of elders.-->

> My missions professor in seminary, Dr. Vern Middleton, made an observation about church polity that has stayed with me until today. According to his observations a church’s polity is more a reflection of the political situation at the time the church was initially formed than it is of any biblical influence. Thus the Episcopal system was developed largely when Emperors, Kings, and Queens ruled; the Presbyterian system was developed largely when city and state councils ruled; the Congregational system was developed largely when democratic systems ruled; and Hybrid systems have developed only in the past 100 years or so.

FPCT:

> TUNAAMINI... Kwamba kila kanisa la mahali chini ya FPCT lina uhuru wa kujiongoza, chini ya Baraza halali la wazee lililoundwa kwa msingi wa Biblia. (Mdo. 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:1-3)
> We believe... That each local church under the FPCT has the freedom to govern itself, under a legitimate Council of Elders formed on the basis of the Bible. (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:1-3)

### Episcopal polity

> For much of the written history of institutional Christianity, episcopal government was the only known form of church organization. This changed at the Reformation. Many Protestant churches are now organized by either congregational or presbyterian church polities, both descended from the writings of John Calvin, a Protestant reformer working and writing independently following the break with the Catholic Church precipitated by The Ninety-Five Theses of Martin Luther. However, some people have disputed the episcopal polity before the reformation, such as Aerius of Sebaste in the 4th century.
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_polity

<!--The orthodox church has multiple leaders in the top position, instead of just one leader, like the pope in the Roman Catholic church. Both are Episcopal. -->

Some believe in apostolic succession.

Who has the authority? Bishops.

### Presbyterian polity

Who has the authority? Councils of elders.

### Congregational polity

> The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) operates through a unique form of governance known as congregational polity, meaning that each local church is autonomous while cooperating voluntarily with others for the sake of the Gospel.
> https://www.sbc.net/about/what-we-do/sbc-governance/

> congregationalism makes every member responsible for establishing churches, for proclaiming the gospel, and for protecting the gospel faithfulness of a church’s members. Presbyterians and episcopalians make the elders and/or bishops responsible for this work.
> https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/hey-christians-polity-matters/

Who has the authority? Either 1) an individual pastor, or 2) the congregation

### Connectional polity

Connection is "The principle, basic to The United Methodist Church, that all leaders and congregations are connected in a network of loyalties and commitments that support, yet supersede, local concerns."<sup>[1]</sup>

> Here again, roots of a relational understanding of connection can be traced back to John Wesley. The earliest Methodist conferences were not formal organizations but rather gatherings of people that had personal relationships with Wesley. Developing Methodist organization grew out of pre-existing relationships among Wesley and the early Methodist preachers and class leaders.
> https://www.umnews.org/en/news/the-many-meanings-of-connectionalism

> A theological understanding of connectionalism affirms that the true nature of the church must include the bonds among congregations. This view contrasts with a congregational understanding of the church, in which each congregation is by itself fully the church. A belief in connectionalism is connected to beliefs about the unity of the church and the catholicity of the church.
