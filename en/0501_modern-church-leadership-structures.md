## Modern church organizational structures

<!-- It would be good to list Tanzanian churches that follow each of these structures-->
<!--bullet points for each to show main characteristics. Compare to other types of polity so that the differences are understood.-->
<!--There is some inconsistency and overlap in these. Some church might be mostly presbyterian, but have bishops (not with apostolic succession) that step in (and maybe overstep) and push certain issues or agendas or try to "fix" problems-->

FPCT:

> TUNAAMINI... Kwamba kila kanisa la mahali chini ya FPCT lina uhuru wa kujiongoza, chini ya Baraza halali la wazee lililoundwa kwa msingi wa Biblia. (Mdo.20:28;1Pet 5:1-3)
> We believe... That each local church under the FPCT has the freedom to govern itself, under a legitimate Council of Elders formed on the basis of the Bible. (Acts 20:28; 1Pet 5:1-3)

### Episcopal polity

> For much of the written history of institutional Christianity, episcopal government was the only known form of church organization. This changed at the Reformation. Many Protestant churches are now organized by either congregational or presbyterian church polities, both descended from the writings of John Calvin, a Protestant reformer working and writing independently following the break with the Catholic Church precipitated by The Ninety-Five Theses of Martin Luther. However, some people have disputed the episcopal polity before the reformation, such as Aerius of Sebaste in the 4th century.

### Presbyterian polity

### Congregational polity

> The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) operates through a unique form of governance known as congregational polity, meaning that each local church is autonomous while cooperating voluntarily with others for the sake of the Gospel.

### Connectional polity

Connection is "The principle, basic to The United Methodist Church, that all leaders and congregations are connected in a network of loyalties and commitments that support, yet supersede, local concerns."<sup>[1]</sup>

> Here again, roots of a relational understanding of connection can be traced back to John Wesley. The earliest Methodist conferences were not formal organizations but rather gatherings of people that had personal relationships with Wesley. Developing Methodist organization grew out of pre-existing relationships among Wesley and the early Methodist preachers and class leaders.

> A theological understanding of connectionalism affirms that the true nature of the church must include the bonds among congregations. This view contrasts with a congregational understanding of the church, in which each congregation is by itself fully the church. A belief in connectionalism is connected to beliefs about the unity of the church and the catholicity of the church.
