# Characteristics of a good leader

We have lists of characteristics that are good for overseers (1 Tim. 3:1–7), deacons (1 Tim. 3:8–13), and elders (Titus 1:5–9). While these lists are good for us to understand what Paul was looking for in a good leader, we have to remember them in their original setting. These are letters written to specific people for a reason. In part, Paul was writing to Timothy and Titus to try to stop false teachers that were causing problems in the church (1 Tim. 1:6–7; Titus 1:10–11). These were things that were opposite of what the false teachers were doing. The following table shows how the qualities of the leaders in the church are opposites of what the false teachers were doing:<sup>[1]</sup>

| possessing the mystery of the faith (1 Tim. 3:9), holding firmly to the faithful word (Titus 1:9)                                                                                                                                   | Teach a different gospel that downplays faith (1 Tim. 1:4, 5, 12–17, 19)                                                                                                                                                                         |

| love what is good (Titus 1:8)                                                                                                                                                                                                       | not love the good (2 Tim. 3:3); lovers of pleasure rather than God (2 Tim. 3:4)                                                                                                                                                                  |

We should not think that these are complete lists of what makes a good leader. Nor should we think these are all absolutes, especially the requirements to be the husband of one wife or have a household to manage, since Paul himself was not married and thus did not have a household.

Besides these longer lists in 1 Timothy and Titus, we have shorter lists that list qualities for leaders:

- Acts 6:3: "Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business."
- 2 Timothy 2:24: "And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,"

The Didache had a similar list in 15:1–2:

> Appoint therefore for yourselves overseers and deacons worthy of the Lord, meek men, and not lovers of money, and truthful and approved, for they also minister to you the ministry of the prophets and teachers. Therefore do not despise them, for they are your honorable men together with the prophets and teachers.<sup>[2]</sup>

Polycarp had a similar lists in his epistle to the Ephesians:

> Likewise must the deacons be blameless before his righteousness, as the servants of God and Christ and not of man, not slanderers, not double tongued, not lovers of money, temperate in all things, compassionate, careful, walking according to the truth of the Lord, who was the "servant of all."

> And let the presbyters also be compassionate, merciful to all, bringing back those that have wandered, caring for all the weak, neglecting neither widow, nor orphan nor poor, but "ever providing for that which is good before God and man," refraining from all wrath, respect of persons, unjust judgment, being far from all love of money, not quickly believing evil of any, not hasty in judgment, knowing that "we all owe the debt of sin."<sup>[3]</sup>

We will not go over every item in these lists, but we will combine these lists together and highlight a few things that are repeated among them.

<!--
Also lists from Greek culture:

> The similarity between the list in 1 Timothy and Onosander is explained by noting the function of the list in the PE: Paul wants the church leaders to possess at a minimum those basic, observable traits that were highly regarded in pagan society. One would be surprised if Paul did not choose some of those qualities that were the common stock of the society to which he was appealing

## Character

All preachers can say they are called of God, but how do we know if they will really be a good leader in the church? We already said before that what makes a good leader in worldly things is not what will make a good leader in spiritual things.

We should not just look for someone who has a strong personality or is a "powerful" preacher. We need to look at how they live their lives. Jesus said we would know a tree by its fruit (Matt. 7:15–20). The only "ministry" ability in the lists in 1 Timothy and Titus is that the overseers and elders should be able to teach. That shows us that Paul considered character to be more important than the ability to speak.

These good characteristics are not things special for only leaders, but they are expected of all Christians. The leader is supposed to be an example of these characteristics.

### Good reputation (1 Tim. 3:2, 7, 8; Titus 1:7)

All people inside and outside the church should know that the church leader is a good person:

- They must be "above reproach" (1 Tim. 3:2)
- They must be "respectable" (1 Tim. 3:2)
- They must "must have a good report of them which are without" (1 Tim. 3:7)
- They must be "worthy of respect" (1 Tim. 3:8)
- They must be "be blameless" (Titus 1:7)

This was also listed as one of the requirements for the helpers in Acts chapter six (Acts 6:3).

### Temperate (1 Tim. 3:2, 11)

> The overseer is to maintain command of his reason, to be watchful and observant of things going on around him, and balanced in his assessments.<sup>[4]</sup>

This was also supposed to be taught to the old men (Titus 2:2).

### Self control (1 Tim. 3:2; Titus 1:8)

The term "self-control" "covers a range of meaning (prudence, moderation, sobriety), but gives the general sense of control over the behavior and the impulses and emotions beneath it."<sup>[5]</sup> Not everything is good for us. We need to learn to say "no" to the things that we want. When we come to Christ, we have to learn to deny ungodliness and worldly passions (Titus 2:11–12).

This is for all believers and not just for leaders (1 Tim. 2:9, 15; Titus 2:2, 4, 5, 6).

<!--I need to check the Greek on these to make sure they are lining up correctly. I was using this table to help me figure this out in English and Swahili, but I am a little unsure, so I want to check it with Greek.

### Not angry (1 Tim. 3:3; Titus 1:7)

- They must not be "a striker" (1 Tim. 3:3; Titus 1:7)
- They must not be "a brawler" (1 Tim. 3:3)
- They must not be "soon angry" (Titus 1:7)

### Not greedy for money (1 Tim. 3:8; Titus 1:7)

A leader in the church should not love money. We will talk more about leaders and money later.

### Must take good care of his family (1 Tim. 3:4, 12; Titus 1:6)

The leader in the church must first be a good leader in the home. If he cannot take care of his family, how can he take care of the church?

### Hospitable (1 Tim. 3:2; Titus 1:8)

"Given the dangers of travel in the empire and the economic uncertainties faced by many believers, the early Christian mission and churches depended upon those who would open their homes and share their goods."<sup>[6]</sup> Jesus did not have His own house, but needed to stay in the house of other people. All Christians were supposed to be ready to receive the guest into their homes (Rom. 12:13; Heb. 13:2; 1 Pet. 4:9; 3 John 1:8).

The Shepherd of Hermas, which was a document used for teaching in the early church, says:

> Overseers and hospitable men who at all times received the servants of God into their houses gladly and without hypocrisy; and the overseers ever ceaselessly sheltered the destitute and the widows by their ministration, and ever behaved with holiness.<sup>[7]</sup>

1 Timothy 3:6 says that a bishop cannot be a novice, but those that mean they must be a certain age? Timothy was a young man and some people thought he should not be a leader. Paul told him to not let other people stop him because he was young (1 Tim. 4:12).

This is talking about spiritual maturity, and not age. The overseer should not be a new Christian.

The elders still have wisdom that comes from life, so we should learn from them (Titus 2:3–4) and respect them (1 Pet. 5:5).

<!--Use of the title "elder."-->

## Marital status

Does someone have to be married to be a leader in the church? Overseers (1 Tim. 3:2), deacons (1 Tim. 3:12), and elders (Titus 1:6) were all to be the husband of one wife. In Greek, there is no difference between the words "woman" and "wife." So in Greek, this prase is "one-woman man." There are four possible meanings to what Paul said.

### Possible meaning 1: The leader must be married

This is not very likely, since Paul was not married (1 Cor. 7:8). He would not tell people to do something that he does not do himself. Other apostles had wives, and Paul had that right to take a wife. He chose not to take a wife so that he would have more freedom to travel and preach the gospel (1 Cor. 9:5).

Paul thought it was good for people who were not married to not seek to get married (1 Cor. 7:25–28). This is because those that are not married only have to care about spiritual things, but those that are married have to care about both spiritual and natural things (1 Cor. 7:32–35). Even Jesus taught that some people choose not to marry for the kingdom of God (Matt. 19:9–12).

Marriage is not a sin. It can even be a good thing. But it can limit your time, resources, and ability to move about.

Marriage can help leaders, because they can learn to be a leader in their home and then be able to be a good leader in the church.

### Possible meaning 2: The leader must not have more than one wife at one time

This is not likely what Paul meant, since not many Jews or Christians practiced polygamy.<sup>[8]</sup>

### Possible meaning 3: The leader must be faithful to his current wife

"This would allow for the possibility of an overseer being remarried after a death, divorce, or possibly adultery in the distant past but would disallow polygamy and sexual immorality (even if the overseer were not married, since the guidelines would be no less stringent for the unmarried than the married)."<sup>[9]</sup>

### Possible meaning 4: The leader must not marry again

In is possible that this means that the leader should not be divorced and married again.

In the second century, the church widely believed that this meant that the leader should not marry a second time, even if his first wife died.<sup>[10]</sup> They believed this because the leader was supposed to be a symbol of Christ marrying the church and Christ cannot marry a second church.

<!--
> We have already said, that a bishop, a presbyter, and a deacon, when they are constituted, must be but once married, whether their wives be alive or whether they be dead; and that it is not lawful for them, if they are unmarried when they are ordained, to be married afterwards; or if they be then married, to marry a second time, but to be content with that wife, which they had when they came to ordination. We also appoint that the ministers, and singers, and readers, and porters, shall be only once married. But if they entered into the clergy before they were married, we permit them to marry, if they have an inclination thereto, lest they sin and incur punishment. But we do not permit any one of the clergy to take to wife either a courtesan, or a servant, or a widow, or one that is divorced, as also the law says. (6.3.17; ANF 7:457)

#### Conclusion to marriage status

Because of the difficult Greek language, it is difficult to know exactly which of these possibilities Paul intended. Without doubt, the passages are speaking of fidelity in marriage. That is, monogamous and acceptable in the eyes of the community.<sup>[11]</sup>

Paul included this in his list to show that it was good (although not necessary) for leaders in the church to be married. This is important, because the false teachers in Ephesus were forbidding people to be married (1 Tim. 4:3).

## Gender

Does a church leader have to be a man?

### In the Bible, there are many women who work for God

In the Old Testament:

- Miriam (Exodus 15:20)
- Deborah (Judges 4:4)
- Huldah (2 Kings 22:14; 2 Chronicles 34:22)
- The wife of Isaiah (Isaiah 8:3)
- Sons and daughters will prophesy (Joel 2:28–29)

In the New Testament:

- Elisabeth (Luke 1:41–42)
- Mary Mother of Jesus (Luke 1:46–55)
- Anna (Luke 2:36–38)
- Unnamed patrons (mfazili) of Jesus (Luke 8:1–3)
- Women followers of Jesus (Mark 15:40–41)
- Mary Magdalene (John 20:18)
- Tabitha (Acts 9:36)
- Lydia (Acts 16:14)
- Priscilla (Acts 18:26)
- Philip's daughters (Acts 21:9)
- Phoebe (Rom. 16:1)
- Junia (Rom. 16:7)
- Mother of Rufus (Romans 16:13)
- Mary, Tryphaena, Tryphosa, and Persis "who has worked hard in the Lord" (Romans 16:6, 12)
- Euodia and Syntyche (Philippians 4:2–3)
- Lois and Eunice (2 Tim. 1:5)
- Older women who train the younger (Titus 2:3–5)
- Peter said daughters would prophesy

Besides these, Jesus had deep theological conversations with women, which shows that women were able to think about the things of God.

### Then why does Paul say not to let women teach in the church?

1 Timothy 2:11–12 and 1 Corinthians 14:34–35 are two Scriptures that seem to show that Paul does not let women speak in church.

Some people think that because of these verses that women should not be allowed to be leaders in the church. Other people read about the women who work for God and believe that women can be leaders in the church. No matter what you decide, you have to find a way to reconcile these passages of Paul with the fact that so many women ministered in the early church.

It is possible that Paul was dealing with specific issues of the churches he was writing to and not overall commands to the church at large.

### Possible explanations

These are some of the most difficult passages in the Bible and many intelligent scholars come to different answers on both sides.

#### These are commands for the whole church for all time and women should not be allowed to speak in the church

This is what many people believe. But it does not explain why there are so many women that worked for God in the New Testament.

#### Paul was trying to fix specific problems with women in these churches (Corinth and Ephesus) and they are not universal prohibitions

For the passage in 1 Corinthians, we know Paul was writing to fix problems of disorder in the church. Earlier in the letter he writes to fix disorder about speaking in tongues and prophesying. (There Paul says that women can pray aloud and prophesy in the church. See 1 Cor. 11:5.) When he moves to talk about women, he is possibly trying to fix a problem of the specific women in Corinth causing disruption and not trying to teach something to all churches everywhere.

As for 1 Timothy, there were women in the church in Ephesus that had turned away from the truth and were following false teachers (2 Tim. 3:6). It is possible that Paul was trying to stop these specific women from causing more division in the church.

#### Paul was speaking in cultural contexts and was trying to adopt to them

It is possible that the women in these churches were uneducated because they were not allowed to attend schools or the synagogue. Because they did not understand everything, they were asking their husbands questions and disrupting the church.

1 Corinthians 14:34 says that the law says that women "are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission." There is no Law in the Old Testament that says anything like that. It is possible that "the law" was not Jewish, but Roman. If that is so, there here it should be translated "husband" and "wife" instead of "man" and "woman." There were Roman laws that did not let a wife correct her husband in public.

<!-- Had the Apostle heard of Gaia Afrania, wife of Licinius Buccio, a contentious lady who insisted on pleading her own causes in court, and was such a nuisance to the praetors that an edict was made prohibiting women from pleading? She died B.C. 48. For Greek sentiment on the subject see Thuc. II. xlv. 2.

#### Paul was speaking of his own idea and not an idea directly from God

In 1 Timothy 1:12, Paul says that he himself does not let women speak. He does not say it is a commandment from God. This is not the only time Paul gives advice that is not directly a commandment from God (See 1 Cor. 7:25). But Paul in other places did work with women, so this explanation is unlikely.

### Conclusion on gender

At the far ends of this debate are people who say women should do nothing at all in the church (such as the medieval church that banned congregational singing so that women would not sing) and those who see absolutely no difference between man and women in ministry. Most people fall somewhere between these two poles. Some say women cannot preach, but will let women sing and testify. Some believe women can be preachers, but not pastors or overseers.
