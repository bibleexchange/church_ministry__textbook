# Types of leaders in the church

Today we have the idea of one leader in the church, the pastor, who is responsible for all decisions in the church and who cares for both spiritual and physical needs of the church. There is indication from Scripture that in the early church there was not a singular leader, but different leaders who each had different responsibilities. Some taught and preached while others took care of physical things. There is no indication from Scripture that one position was more important than others or that one person had more power than others.

The New Testament itself gives qualifications for some positions of leadership, but it does not describe what those positions were and what they were supposed to do. We have two lists of types of leaders that have different titles in them. I Timothy 3:1-13 lists overseers and deacons and Ephesians 4:11 lists apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher. In I Corinthians 12:28 we have a list that shares three of the titles from Ephesians 4:11 (apostles, prophets, and teachers). We can say that the list in Ephesians are people appointed by God for the good of the church and the list in I Timothy are leaders appointed by humans in the church. There can be overlap between these two lists. Someone can be both a pastor and an overseer and another person may be a pastor but not an overseer. The Didache, which was an early document used by the church, makes this clear by saying that people who are overseers or deacons do the ministry of prophets and teachers:

> Didache 15:1  
> Elect, therefore, for yourselves overseers and deacons worthy of the Lord, men who are meek and not covetous, and true and approved, for they perform for you the service of prophets and teachers.<sup>[1]</sup>

There is also the title "elder," which is possibly a general term for any leader in the church or it is a title used for leaders in the church that are neither overseer or deacon.

We should not think that these lists show the only leaders and ministries in the church, but they show some of them. There can also be people who are singers, treasurers, or cooks. We see the leaders chosen in Acts for the purpose of giving food to the poor. There have been many missionaries that have been doctors and nurses.

<!--The earliest New Testament writings just uses "leaders" instead of specific titles (See ??). This could mean that at that time the system of organized leadership in the church had not yet been formalized. (Source ??)-->

<!--
> Now Paul goes on to speak of the specific gifts that he has given. The gifts are the people. All, in their particular ministries, are God’s gift to the church. ‘To Christ’, says Calvin, ‘we owe it that we have ministers of the gospel.’ The church may appoint people to different work and functions, but unless they have the gifts of the Spirit, and therefore are themselves the gifts of Christ to his church, their appointment is valueless.

> At the later date which some would give to this letter it would seem almost impossible not to have reference to the local ministry of bishops, presbyters and deacons which had come to be of greatest importance to the church. As it is, the apostle is not thinking of the ministers of Christ in their offices but rather according to their specific spiritual gifts and their work, and not least of those who in the exercise of their functions were not limited to a particular locality.

## Coworker

> The term most frequently used by Paul to describe specific individuals is ‘co-worker’ (συνεργός), which occurs twelve times and is widely distributed across the corpus.
> (Rom. 16:3, 9, 21; 1 Cor. 3:9; 2 Cor. 1:24; 8:23; Phil. 2:25; 4:3; Col. 4:11; 1 Thess. 3:2; Phlm. 1, 24.)
> Clarke, A. D. (2012). A Pauline Theology of Church Leadership (M. Goodacre, Ed.; Vol. 362). Bloomsbury.

## Apostle

The title comes from a Greek word meaning "one who is sent."

> In NT it is applied to Jesus as the Sent One of God (Heb. 3:1), to those sent by God to preach to Israel (Lk. 11:49) and to those sent by churches (2 Cor. 8:23; Phil. 2:25); but above all it is applied absolutely to the group of men who held the supreme dignity in the primitive church
> Walls, A. F. (1996). Apostle. In D. R. W. Wood, I. H. Marshall, A. R. Millard, J. I. Packer, & D. J. Wiseman (Eds.), New Bible dictionary (3rd ed., p. 58). InterVarsity Press.

There are two meanings of apostle:

1. A messenger
2. A witness of the resurrected Christ

### Messenger

Sometimes in the New Testament, the verb form (apostello) is used, such as when Jesus sent out the 70 in Luke 10:1.

2 Corinthians 8:23 (KJV 1900)
23Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.

Philippians 2:25 (KJV 1900)
25Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.

Jesus was called an apostle (Heb. 3:1), probably in the sense that He brought the message of the Gospel to the world.

Didache 11:3-6
3 And concerning the Apostles and Prophets, act thus according to the ordinance of the Gospel. 4 Let every Apostle who comes to you be received as the Lord, 5 but let him not stay more than one day, or if need be a second as well; but if he stay three days, he is a false prophet. 6 And when an Apostle goes forth let him accept nothing but bread till he reach his night’s lodging; but if he ask for money, he is a false prophet.

### Witness of the resurrected Christ

> From Paul’s words in 1 Corinthians 9:1–2 it would seem that a necessary qualification of an apostle was to have seen the risen Lord, and to have been sent out by him, and thus to have come to be engaged as a foundation member (Eph. 2:20) and worker for the building up of the church.
> Foulkes, F. (1989). Ephesians: an introduction and commentary (Vol. 10, p. 124). InterVarsity Press.

People who are called apostles in the New Testament:

- The Twelve (Matt. 10:2-4; **Luke 6:13**; Rev. 21:14)
- Paul
- Barnabas (Acts 14:14)
- James the Lord’s brother (Gal. 1:19)
- Silas (1 Thess. 2:6)
- Junias and Andronicus (Romans 16:7)
- Unnamed apostles (1 Cor. 15:7)

Apostles and prophets were essential to the founding of the church (Eph: 2:20). Apostles and prophets are often gouped together (Luke 11:49; Eph. 2:20; 3:5; 4:11; 1 Cor. 2:28).

Today we cannot be an apostle in the sense of a witness to the resurrect Christ, but we can be messengers.

## Prophet

Some prophets in the New Testament:

- Barnabas, Simeon Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen (Acts 13:1-3)
- Judas (Acts 15:32)
- Silas (Acts 15:32)
- Seven daughters of Philip (Acts 21:8-9)
- Agabus (Acts 21:10)

Shepherd of Hermas Mandate 11:7-8
7 “How, then,” said I, “sir, shall a man know which of them is a true prophet and which a false prophet?” “Listen,” said he, “concerning both the prophets, and as I shall tell you, so you shall judge the true prophet and the false prophet. Test the man who has the Divine Spirit by his life. 8 In the first place, he who has the spirit which is from above, is meek and gentle, and lowly-minded, and refrains from all wickedness and evil desire of this world, and make himself poorer than all men, and gives no answers to anyone when he is consulted, nor does he speak by himself (for the Holy Spirit does not speak when a man wishes to speak), but he speaks at that time when God wishes him to speak.

## Evangelist

The meaning of Greek word is "to announce news."

Philip was an evangelist (Acts 21:8). (In SUV is just translated as "preacher of the Gospel).

They went new places to convert people to Christianity and to start new churches.

But they also had some aspect of ministry in the church, because Paul told Timothy, who was a leader in the church, to do the work of an evangelist (2 Tim. 4:5).

> In the post-apostolic period it is the evangelists who continue to carry out many of the activities of the apostles and it is the pastors who now exercise the leadership role, alongside the teachers, previously held by the prophets
> Lincoln, A. T. (1990). Ephesians (Vol. 42, p. 250). Word, Incorporated.

## Pastor

The noun is only used one time in the New Testament as a word for a church leader (Eph. 4:11) and two times in the verb form (1 Pet. 5:1-4; Acts 20:28).

Even though today this is the most common name for a church leader, we have very little information from the Bible about what the duties were of the pastor.

## Teacher

Because the text says, "na wengine kuwa wachungaji na waalimu" and not "na wengine kuwa wachungaji na **wengine kuwa** waalimu" some people believe that these two positions are combined.

> It is more likely that they were overlapping functions, but that while almost all pastors were also teachers, not all teachers were also pastors. Whether the two functions were performed by a single individual within a particular local situation may well have depended on what gifted persons were present in that situation
> Lincoln, A. T. (1990). Ephesians (Vol. 42, p. 250). Word, Incorporated.

There are not any people in the New Testament that have the title of "teacher," but there are many people who do teaching.

> James 3:1
> 3 Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.

Didache 11:1-2
1 WHOSOEVER then comes and teaches you all these things aforesaid, receive him. 2 But if the teachers himself be perverted and teach another doctrine to destroy these things, do not listen to him, but if his teaching be for the increase of righteousness and knowledge of the Lord, receive him as the Lord.

## Overseer/Bishop (episkopē | Trans. askofu in SUV and BHN & mwangalizi in Neno)

Read 1 Timothy 3:1-7

> The basic meaning of the word group is “oversight”: the idea of watching over someone or something.
> Mounce, W. D. (2000). Pastoral Epistles (Vol. 46, p. 168). Word, Incorporated.

> The statement, If anyone sets his heart on being an overseer, makes use of a word episkopos, which later came to be used for bishops (RSV has ‘bishop’). In its original usage, at least until the time of Ignatius, it was restricted to those who exercised oversight in the local church. In the proverbial saying in this verse, the office referred to is quite general and might encompass any position, secular or ecclesiastical, where ‘oversight’ was necessary.
> Guthrie, D. (1990). Pastoral Epistles: An Introduction and Commentary (Vol. 14, p. 94). InterVarsity Press.

> I Clement 44:1
> 1 OUR Apostles also knew through our Lord Jesus Christ that there would be strife for the title of bishop.

> Didache 15:1-4
> 1 APPOINT therefore for yourselves bishops and deacons worthy of the Lord, meek men, and not lovers of money, and truthful and approved, for they also minister to you the ministry of the prophets and teachers.
> 2 Therefore do not despise them, for they are your honourable men together with the prophets and teachers.
> 3 And reprove one another not in wrath but in peace as you find in the Gospel, and let none speak with any who has done a wrong to his neighbour, nor let him hear a word from you until he repents.
> 4 But your prayers and alms and all your acts perform as ye find in the Gospel of our Lord.

Some people think that overseers and deacons were the same thing, but Philippians 1:1 show them as two separate positions:

> Php 1:1
> PAUL and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:

### Ignatius on church hierarchy

<!-- I might move this to a section on early church organization -->

By the time of Ignatius in the second century (107 AD), the modern concept of this being a single bishop in each location who was leader over other leaders became common, but there is no evidence that that was the original meaning:

> Ignatius advocated strongly for a “head” bishop for each metropolitan church with presbyters being under his authority, and with deacons being under the authority of the presbyters—a hierarchical episcopacy consisting of these three tiers. (e.g. Eph 2:2; 5:3; Trall 2: 1-2; 13:2; Polyc 6:1)
> http://bishopjerrylhayes.blogspot.com/2015/06/church-structure-bishop-ignatius-of.html

He taught that the the bishop spoke directly for God and that to disobey the bishop was to disobey God.

In the early church, there is no indication that the bishop was more important or more powerful than other people, as we see in Phil. 1:1:

> Another general difference is that in Ignatius the bishop and presbyters stand out directly from the laity. In the PE and the NT the leadership is much more part of the church. Fee comments on Phil 1:1, “The community as a whole is addressed, and in most cases therefore the ‘overseers and deacons’ are simply reckoned as being within the community. When they are singled out, as here, the leaders are not ‘over’ the church, but are addressed ‘alongside of’ the church, as a distinguishable part of the whole, but as part of the whole, not above or outside it” (Philippians, 67)
> Mounce, W. D. (2000). Pastoral Epistles (Vol. 46, p. 187). Word, Incorporated.

Note also, there are references to more than one bishop in this single city, which removes the idea that is is a singular leader for the city, as Ignatius says.

## Deacon/Servant (diakonis | Trans. mashemasi in SUV and Neno & wasaidizi in BHN)

Read 1 Timothy 3:8-13.

The word is the same word for "servant" (mtumishi | mahuduma). The Greek has a different word for slave (duolos | mtumwa), which is not what is used here.

### Unofficial positions

This can also be used as an unofficial title. Jesus said all leaders in the kingdom of God have to be servants (diakonis) (Matt. 20:26). Some people who are deacons or elders could also be called servants.

Paul and Apolos were called servants (1 Cor. 3:5)

> The term διάκονος was common in the Greek world, used to describe many different occupations.
> Mounce, W. D. (2000). Pastoral Epistles (Vol. 46, p. 196). Word, Incorporated.

> The creative power of the early Church was strong enough to fashion its own offices for the conduct of congregational life and divine worship.… Early Christianity took over words which were predominantly secular in their current usage and which had not yet been given any sharply defined sense. It linked these words with offices which were being fashioned in the community, and thus gave them a new sense which was so firmly welded with the activity thereby denoted that in all languages they have been adopted as loan-words to describe Christian office-bearers. (TDNT 2:91)
> Mounce, W. D. (2000). Pastoral Epistles (Vol. 46, p. 197). Word, Incorporated.

### Official position in the church

> There is no suggestion in the text that the deacon is subordinate to the overseer. Both performed vital functions in the church, and it is the deacon who is expressly told that a reward awaits those who serve well.  
> Mounce, W. D. (2000). Pastoral Epistles (Vol. 46, p. 196). Word, Incorporated.

When comparing the requirements for overseer and deacon in I Timothy chapter 3, we the difference that deacons were not required to teach.

> The requirements for a deacon suggest that there would be substantial contact with people: not double-tongued; a dignified wife; faithful in marriage; a well-managed family. The requirement that they not be greedy may suggest some responsibility for the church’s purse, perhaps in the disbursement of funds to the poor.  
> Mounce, W. D. (2000). Pastoral Epistles (Vol. 46, p. 195). Word, Incorporated.

Because the same word is used in an official and unofficial manner, sometimes we have to guess which meaning is meant. Some people that say that women cannot be in ministry say that Phoebe was only a servant and not a deacon(ess).

### List of deacons in the New Testament:

- Phoebe (Rom. 16:1)
- Tychicus (Eph. 6:21)

Many times in the early church, female deacons were called "widows." (wajane)

## Elder (εώτεροι | neōteros) and Presbyter (πρεσβύτερος | presbyteros) (Trans. mzee in all SW versions)

This is the most common name for leaders in the church. It could just refer to an older peron in the church, but also could be an actual appointed position:

> Acts 14:23 (TNIV)  
> 23 Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church and, with prayer and fasting, committed them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.

Titus 1:5-9 gives a list of qualifications of elders.

> Jas 5:14 (TNIV)
> 14 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.

In the 2nd and 3rd epistles of John, John calls himself an elder.

Peter calls himself an elder (1 Peter 5:1)

> Polycarp to the Ephesians chapter 6
> And the presbyters [πρεσβύτεροι] also must be compassionate, merciful towards all men, turning back the sheep that are gone astray, visiting all the infirm, not neglecting a widow or an orphan or a poor man: but providing always for that which is honorable in the sight of God and of men, abstaining from all anger, respect of persons, unrighteous judgment, being far from all love of money, not quick to believe anything against any man, not hasty in judgment, knowing that we are all debtors of sin. (Phil. 6; tr. Lightfoot, Apostolic Fathers, 179)
> Mounce, W. D. (2000). Pastoral Epistles (Vol. 46, p. 188). Word, Incorporated.
