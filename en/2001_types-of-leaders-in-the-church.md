# Kinds of leaders in the church

Today we have the idea of one leader in the church, the pastor, who is responsible for all decisions in the church and who cares for both spiritual and physical needs of the church. There is indication from Scripture that in the early church there was not a singular leader, but different leaders who each had different responsibilities. Some taught and preached while others took care of physical things. There is no indication from Scripture that one position was more important than others or that one person had more power than others.

The New Testament gives qualifications for some positions of leadership, but it does not describe what those positions were and what they were supposed to do. We have two lists of types of leaders that have different titles in them. I Timothy 3:1-13 lists overseers and deacons and Ephesians 4:11 lists apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher. In I Corinthians 12:28 we have a list that shares three of the titles from Ephesians 4:11 (apostles, prophets, and teachers). We can say that the list in Ephesians are people appointed by God for the good of the church and the list in I Timothy are leaders appointed by humans in the church. There can be overlap between these two lists. Someone can be both a pastor and an overseer and another person may be a pastor but not an overseer. The Didache, which was an early document used by the church, makes this clear by saying that people who are overseers or deacons do the ministry of prophets and teachers:

> Didache 15:1  
> Elect, therefore, for yourselves overseers and deacons worthy of the Lord, men who are meek and not covetous, and true and approved, for they perform for you the service of prophets and teachers.<sup>[1]</sup>

There is also the title "elder," which is possibly a general term for any leader in the church or it is a title used for leaders in the church that are neither overseer or deacon.

We should not think that these lists show the only leaders and ministries in the church, but they show some of them. There can also be people who are singers, treasurers, or cooks. We see the leaders chosen in Acts for the purpose of giving food to the poor. There have been many missionaries that have been doctors and nurses.

Many of the words used by the church for leaders were words already commonly used in the Greek language for secular positions. This brings confusion to us because we are not always sure from the use of the word if it is talking about an official church position or just a general description of the person and what they did.

<!--The earliest New Testament writings just uses "leaders" instead of specific titles (See ??). This could mean that at that time the system of organized leadership in the church had not yet been formalized. (Source ??)-->

<!--
> Now Paul goes on to speak of the specific gifts that he has given. The gifts are the people. All, in their particular ministries, are God’s gift to the church. ‘To Christ’, says Calvin, ‘we owe it that we have ministers of the gospel.’ The church may appoint people to different work and functions, but unless they have the gifts of the Spirit, and therefore are themselves the gifts of Christ to his church, their appointment is valueless.

> At the later date which some would give to this letter it would seem almost impossible not to have reference to the local ministry of bishops, presbyters and deacons which had come to be of greatest importance to the church. As it is, the apostle is not thinking of the ministers of Christ in their offices but rather according to their specific spiritual gifts and their work, and not least of those who in the exercise of their functions were not limited to a particular locality.

<!--What seems to be clear from the two relevant letters to coworkers is that neither Timothy nor Titus exercises a local church role. Timothy appears to relate to the single Ephesian church in the capacity of apostolic delegate (1:3). Titus, however, in the same capacity appears to be in charge of at least several churches associated with Cretan towns (Titus 1:5).

<!--In the Corinthian church, along with the more ecstatic gifts are the gifts of being helpers (ἀντιλήμψεις) and administrators (κυβερνήσεις; 1 Cor 12:28).

Need to research this, since KJV completely translates these positions differently.-->

<!--Nowhere are any of these titles applied to Timothy. Paul’s admonition to Timothy as the “Lord’s servant” (2 Tim 2:24–25) lists qualities that are similar to those listed for overseers and deacons, but it says nothing about Timothy being an overseer. He stands outside the local church structure as Paul’s delegate with the authority to enforce Paul’s decisions

The Greek word for servant is doulos-->

## Coworker

The term most frequently used by Paul to describe specific individuals is "co-worker," which occurs twelve times in his writing (Rom. 16:3, 9, 21; I Cor. 3:9; II Cor. 1:24; 8:23; Phil. 2:25; 4:3; Col. 4:11; I Thess. 3:2; Phlm. 1, 24).<sup>[2]</sup>

## Apostle

The title comes from a Greek word meaning "one who is sent." There are two meanings of apostle:

1. A messenger
2. A witness of the resurrected Christ

### Messenger

This is a title used for those that were preaching the gospel in the churches (II Cor. 8:23; Phil. 2:25). Sometimes in the New Testament, the verb form (apostello) is used, such as when Jesus sent out the 70 in Luke 10:1.

Jesus was called an apostle (Heb. 3:1), probably in the sense that He brought the message of the Gospel to the world.

The Didache gives instructions on how to know if an apostle is true. If they ask for money or take advantage of your hospitality, then they are not a real apostle. This shows that in the early church there were people using this title to try to find personal gain:

> Didache 11:3-6  
> And concerning the Apostles and Prophets, act thus according to the ordinance of the Gospel. Let every Apostle who comes to you be received as the Lord, but let him not stay more than one day, or if need be a second as well; but if he stay three days, he is a false prophet. And when an Apostle goes forth let him accept nothing but bread till he reach his night’s lodging; but if he ask for money, he is a false prophet.

### Witness of the resurrected Christ

"From Paul’s words in 1 Corinthians 9:1–2 it would seem that a necessary qualification of an apostle was to have seen the risen Lord, and to have been sent out by him, and thus to have come to be engaged as a foundation member (Eph. 2:20) and worker for the building up of the church."<sup>[3]</sup>

These are the people who are called apostles in the New Testament:

- The Twelve (Matt. 10:2-4; **Luke 6:13**; Rev. 21:14)
- Paul (Rom. 1:1)
- Barnabas (Acts 14:14)
- James the Lord’s brother (Gal. 1:19)
- Silas (1 Thess. 2:6)
- Junias and Andronicus (Romans 16:7)
- Unnamed apostles (1 Cor. 15:7)

Apostles and prophets were essential to the founding of the church (Eph: 2:20). Apostles and prophets are often grouped together (Luke 11:49; Eph. 2:20; 3:5; 4:11; 1 Cor. 2:28).

Today we cannot be an apostle in the sense of a witness to the resurrect Christ, but we can be messengers.

## Prophet

A prophet is one who speaks as a direct messenger for God. Here are some prophets in the New Testament:

- Barnabas, Simeon Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen (Acts 13:1-3)
- Judas (Acts 15:32)
- Silas (Acts 15:32)
- Seven daughters of Philip (Acts 21:8-9)
- Agabus (Acts 21:10)

The Shepherd of Hermas, which was a document used by the early church, tells how to know if a prophet is real or not:

> Shepherd of Hermas, Mandate 11:7-8  
> “How, then,” said I, “sir, shall a man know which of them is a true prophet and which a false prophet?” “Listen,” said he, “concerning both the prophets, and as I shall tell you, so you shall judge the true prophet and the false prophet. Test the man who has the Divine Spirit by his life. In the first place, he who has the spirit which is from above, is meek and gentle, and lowly-minded, and refrains from all wickedness and evil desire of this world, and make himself poorer than all men, and gives no answers to anyone when he is consulted, nor does he speak by himself (for the Holy Spirit does not speak when a man wishes to speak), but he speaks at that time when God wishes him to speak.

## Evangelist

The meaning of Greek word is "to announce news."

Philip was an evangelist (Acts 21:8). (In the SUV it is just translated as "preacher of the Gospel.) Evangelists went to new places to convert people to Christianity and to start new churches. But they also had some aspect of ministry in the church, because Paul told Timothy, who was a leader in the church, to do the work of an evangelist (2 Tim. 4:5).

<!--
> In the post-apostolic period it is the evangelists who continue to carry out many of the activities of the apostles and it is the pastors who now exercise the leadership role, alongside the teachers, previously held by the prophets
> Lincoln, A. T. (1990). Ephesians (Vol. 42, p. 250). Word, Incorporated.-->

## Pastor

The noun is only used one time in the New Testament as a word for a church leader (Eph. 4:11) and two times in the verb form (I Pet. 5:1-4; Acts 20:28).

Even though today this is the most common name for a church leader, we have very little information from the Bible about what the duties were of the pastor.

## Teacher

Because the text says, "na wengine kuwa wachungaji na waalimu" and not "na wengine kuwa wachungaji na **wengine kuwa** waalimu" some people believe that these two positions are combined. "It is more likely that they were overlapping functions, but that while almost all pastors were also teachers, not all teachers were also pastors. Whether the two functions were performed by a single individual within a particular local situation may well have depended on what gifted persons were present in that situation."<sup>[4]</sup>

There are not any people in the New Testament that have the title of "teacher," but there are many people who do teaching.

Not everyone should desire to be a teacher, because a teacher will be judged more strictly by God (James 3:1).

The Didache tells how to know a good teacher:

> Didache 11:1-2  
> Whosoever then comes and teaches you all these things aforesaid, receive him. But if the teachers himself be perverted and teach another doctrine to destroy these things, do not listen to him, but if his teaching be for the increase of righteousness and knowledge of the Lord, receive him as the Lord.

## Overseer/Bishop

The Greek word is _episkopē_, which means "overseer." In fact, the Neno Biblia Takatifu translates this to be "mwangalizi." The title _overseer_ "in its original usage, at least until the time of Ignatius, ...was restricted to those who exercised oversight in the local church. ...the office referred to is quite general and might encompass any position, secular or ecclesiastical, where ‘oversight’ was necessary."<sup>[5]</sup>

Some people think that overseers and deacons were the same thing, but Philippians 1:1 show them as two separate positions. I Timothy 3:1-7 gives a list of qualifications for the overseer. The Didache also gives a list of qualifications:

> Didache 15:1-4  
> Appoint therefore for yourselves bishops and deacons worthy of the Lord, meek men, and not lovers of money, and truthful and approved, for they also minister to you the ministry of the prophets and teachers. Therefore do not despise them, for they are your honorable men together with the prophets and teachers. And reprove one another not in wrath but in peace as you find in the Gospel, and let none speak with any who has done a wrong to his neighbor, nor let him hear a word from you until he repents. But your prayers and alms and all your acts perform as ye find in the Gospel of our Lord.

<!--Acts 20:28 (KJV 1900)
28Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
-->

<!--Jesus is the overseer of our souls:
1 Peter 2:25 (KJV 1900)
25For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
-->

### Ignatius on church hierarchy

By the time of Ignatius in the second century (107 AD), there was one "head" bishop for each city. These were over the elders, who were over the deacons.<sup>[6]</sup> Ignatius taught that the the bishop spoke directly for God and that to disobey the bishop was to disobey God.

In the New Testament, Philippians 1:1 is the verse that shows us that the system of Ignatius was not what was happening in the time of Paul. This verse shows that the bishops (overseers) and elders were not over the whole congregation, but were included alongside the rest of the congregation.<sup>[7]</sup> This verse also shows more than one bishop in one city, so that goes against the idea of Ignatius that each city should have only one bishop.

Even if the idea of the bishop being more powerful than other people in the church does not come directly from the New Testament, by the second century, it was common in the church. Because there was only one bishop in a city, people fought for the position of bishop. Clement, who was an early church father, knew that many people would fight to be bishop. This shows that at some time, the position became to be a more prominent position in the church:

> I Clement 44:1  
> Our Apostles also knew through our Lord Jesus Christ that there would be strife for the title of bishop.

## Deacon/Servant

I Timothy 3:8-13 gives the qualifications for deacons. The word in Greek is _diakonis_, which means "servant." The Biblia Habari Neno translates it as "wasaidizi." Greek has a different word for slave (duolos), which is not what is used here.

### Unofficial positions

This can be used as an unofficial title. Jesus said all leaders in the kingdom of God have to be servants (diakonis in Greek) (Matt. 20:26). Some people who are deacons or elders could also be called servants. Paul and Apollos were called servants (I Cor. 3:5). This word did not originally come from the church, but it was a common word used to describe many different occupations.<sup>[8]</sup>

> The creative power of the early Church was strong enough to fashion its own offices for the conduct of congregational life and divine worship.… Early Christianity took over words which were predominantly secular in their current usage and which had not yet been given any sharply defined sense. It linked these words with offices which were being fashioned in the community, and thus gave them a new sense which was so firmly welded with the activity thereby denoted that in all languages they have been adopted as loan-words to describe Christian office-bearers.<sup>[9]</sup>

### Official position in the church

Because the same word is used in an official and unofficial manner, it is difficult to know when some is called a servant (a good worker in the church) or if the are being called a deacon (an actual ordained leader in the church). There are two people in the New Testament that are possibly official deacons:

- Phoebe (Rom. 16:1)
- Tychicus (Eph. 6:21)

People who do not believe that woman can hold positions in the church say that Phoebe was only a servant. It is possible that in the early church, female deacons were called "widows."

We sometimes think that the deacon is a lesser position than the overseer, but "there is no suggestion in the text that the deacon is subordinate to the overseer. Both performed vital functions in the church, and it is the deacon who is expressly told that a reward awaits those who serve well."<sup>[10]</sup>

When comparing the requirements for overseer and deacon in I Timothy chapter 3, we the difference that deacons were not required to teach.

> The requirements for a deacon suggest that there would be substantial contact with people: not double-tongued; a dignified wife; faithful in marriage; a well-managed family. The requirement that they not be greedy may suggest some responsibility for the church’s purse, perhaps in the disbursement of funds to the poor.<sup>[11]</sup>

## Elder

<!--fix this first sentence in SW, because I sent it off to the translator wrong:-->

This is the most common name for leaders in the church. The Greek word is _presbyteros_, which means "an older person." In all Swahili translations this word is translated as "mzee."

It could just refer to an older peron in the church, but also could be an actual appointed position, as we see in Acts 14:23 when Paul and Barnabas appointed elders in the church. Titus 1:5-9 gives a list of qualifications of elders. Polycarp, who was taught by the Apostle John, also gave a list of qualifications for elders:

> And the presbyters also must be compassionate, merciful towards all men, turning back the sheep that are gone astray, visiting all the infirm, not neglecting a widow or an orphan or a poor man: but providing always for that which is honorable in the sight of God and of men, abstaining from all anger, respect of persons, unrighteous judgment, being far from all love of money, not quick to believe anything against any man, not hasty in judgment, knowing that we are all debtors of sin.<sup>[12]</sup>

In the 2nd and 3rd epistles of John, John calls himself an elder and Peter also calls himself an elder (I Pet. 5:1).

The elders were to pray for people in the church that were sick (James 5:14).

<!--Talk about the body of elders-->
<!--The word was used for leaders of the Jews before it was used by the church (Matt. 21:23; Acts 4:5)-->
<!--Elders are paired often with Apostles in the book of Acts (Acts 15:2, 4, 6, 22, 23; 16:4)-->
<!--The titles of overseer and elder are used interchangeably. Paul instructs Titus concerning elders (Titus 1:5) and then in the next breath calls them overseers (Titus 1:7) with no indication that the audience has changed. That the list of qualities in Titus 1 so closely parallels that of the overseers in 1 Tim 3:1–7 suggests that the two terms refer to the same office. This same interchangability is found in Acts 20 where Paul calls the Ephesian elders (v 17) and tells them that as overseers (v 28) they should take care of the church.
