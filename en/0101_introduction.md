# Introduction: Leaders that are not like the world

There is not a lot of information in the New Testament about the structure and function of the early church. We cannot find an exact plan in the Bible about how we should run our churches. Much of what we do in churches is from two thousand years of church history.

Not everything we do in the church comes directly from the Bible. That does not necessarily mean that these things are good or bad. We need to take what little we know from the Bible and compare it to our modern practices to see if we are following the principles laid out in the Bible.

We have to be careful that we do not copy the ideas of the world and use them in the church. As Christians, we should not look to business leaders or politicians as examples of leadership, but church leaders will be different from the leaders of natural things. What the world thinks of as a good leader is not what the Bible says is a good leader:

> Matthew 20:25–26 — But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;

There are also many things from our current church culture that does not come from biblical principles, but are things that were implemented by leaders who wanted to increase their power over others. When we go into our study, we have to clear our minds of all the things that we think about leadership so that we can be ready to learn what the Bible really says about leadership.

## The things that matter to us don't always matter to God

### The number of people is not as important as spiritual growth

Matthew 7:13–14 makes it clear that there will not be many people who enter the kingdom of heaven. As a leader in the church, you should not be focusing on getting many people into the church, but you should focus that the people you do have under your authority grow up spiritually (Eph. 4:11–13). Of course we can do outreach ministry to the lost, but what good is it if people come to church and remain spiritually immature?

### Spiritual gifts are not as important as right relationship with God

Some leaders look to have great power with God, but it is more important that we actually know who God is. Jesus said that in the last day, there will be people who will stand before the judgment and boast of all the miracles that they did. God will tell them to go away because He never knew them (Matt. 7:21–23).

## What is a leader?

### A leader is servant of all

In all four Gospels, Jesus tells his disciples that they are supposed to be servants:

1. Matthew 20:20–28
2. Mark 9:33–37; 10:35–45
3. Luke 22:24–27
4. John 13:12–17

We call leaders in the church "servants" of God, but many times they are not really serving, but instead being served. As leaders, we should not look for special treatment in food, respect, or seating arrangement. When Jesus washed the feet of the disciples, that was the real work of a servant. We need to be ready to sweep floors, wash dishes, or clean the toilets if we want to be leaders in the church.

### A leader is to be a shepherd

We are not here specifically talking about the position of pastor in the church, but all leaders in the church, no matter what their title is, is supposed to take care of the people in the church. We will talk more in a later chapter about the official title of "pastor" in the church.

A leader cares for the needs of others. The command is given two times in the New Testament for the leaders of the church to be shepherds of the flock of God (1 Peter 5:1–4; Acts 20:28). Jesus also told Peter to feed His sheep (John 21:15). The shepherd is one who takes care of all needs of the sheep, including making sure they have food and water and protecting them (Psalm 23).

Jesus is our example as the good shepherd who lays down His life for the sheep (John 10:11). Not everyone that is a leader in the church really cares for the people. Some will run away when things get difficult and leave the people to be scattered by the enemy (John 10:12–13).

<!--Need to expound on this more, since it very specifically talks about protecting from false doctrine:

Acts 20:28–31 (KJV 1900)
28Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
29For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
30Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.
31Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
-->

<!--Titus 1:9–11 (KJV 1900)
9Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
10For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
11Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.
-->

#### The shepherd takes care of spiritual needs

The leaders in the church should make sure that the people understand the Word of God and pray for them when they have trouble in life.

1. Jesus went to all the villages teaching and preaching (Matt. 9:35; Mark 1:38–39)
2. Paul was a teacher (1 Tim. 2:7; 2 Tim. 1:11)
3. The overseer is to be able to teach (1 Tim. 3:2)

> Colossians 1:28 — Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:

<!--Titus 1:9 (KJV 1900)
9Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.

He must protect against false doctrine-->

#### The shepherd takes care of physical needs

In Acts chapter 6, there is a story about the apostles. They were feeding the widows daily. They said they needed to find someone else to do that work, because when they were feeding people physical food, they were not able to have the time to minister in the Word of God (Acts 6:1–8).

Caring for physical needs of people is a neglected aspect of Christian ministry, because like the apostles, we say we cannot leave the preaching of the Word to serve tables. But they still made sure the people were fed, even though they did not do it themselves. They found other leaders who could do that work. As a church, we cannot separate the spiritual needs of the people from the physical needs. There are many places in the New Testament that tell us to care for the physical needs of people:

1. Jesus not only taught the people, but He also gave them physical food (Matthew 15:29–32)
2. Jesus will punish those who ignore the poor (Matthew 25:31–46)
3. The deacons and overseers were to be "given to hospitality" (1 Tim. 3:2; Titus 1:8)
4. "Pure religion" is to help the widows and orphans (James 1:27)
5. We cannot only pray for someone if they have a need, but we need to help them (James 2:15–17)
6. The early church shared all their possessions, so no one had any needs (Acts 4:32–35)
7. We do not have the love of God if we ignore the poor (1 John 3:17–18)
8. We are to help people in the church and outside of the church (Rom. 12:13; Gal. 6:10; Philippians 2:4; 1 Tim. 5:8; 6:17–18; Heb. 13:16)

These commands for helping the poor are for everyone in the church and not only the leaders, but leaders need to be an example of these things.

<!--Paul taking up a collection for the poor saints in Jerusalem.-->

### A leader is to be an example

We cannot only tell others what to do, but we need to also do the things that we teach and preach. We should want other people imitate us and follow in what we do (Titus 2:7; Hebrews 13:7).

Timothy was young, so some people did not respect him. Paul told him to not let them stop them but to be an example of the faith (1 Tim. 4:12).

We do not force people to do what is right, but we do what is right and others will see and follow (I Pet. 5:3).

Jesus condemned the religious leaders because they told the people to do one thing, but did something different (Matt. 23:2–3). Paul said something similar in Romans 2:21–23.

If we follow Jesus, when people follow us, they are really following Jesus (1 Cor. 11:1).

### A leader builds up

The reason that God gave ministers to the church was so that they could build up the church (Eph. 4:11–13). This is not talking about building up a building, but about people growing spiritually until they become like Jesus.

Every act of worship in the church should be to build up the people (1 Cor. 14:26).

The authority given to leaders is to be used to build up and not tear down (2 Cor. 10:8; 13:10).

All Christians should try to build each other up (Rom. 14:19; 15:2; I Thess. 5:11).
