# The location of the early churches

(Maybe the social setting of the early church)

In houses.

1 Corinthians 16:19 (KJV 1900)
19The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.

> Prisca and Aquila are recognized as having a church (assembly) that meets in their home (τὴν κατʼ οἶκον αὐτῶν ἐκκλησίαν, Rom. 16:5; 1 Cor. 16:19); Nympha hosts a church in her house (τὴν κατʼ οἶκον αὐτῆς ἐκκλησίαν, Col. 4:15); Philemon hosts a church in his house (τῇ κατʼ οἶκόν σου ἐκκλησίᾳ, Phlm. 2); and Gaius appears to have been a host both to Paul and to the whole Corinthian community (ὁ ξένος μου καὶ ὅλης τῆς ἐκκλησίας, Rom. 16:23)

> Throughout the NT the terms for leadership are usually plural (1 Cor 12:28; Eph 4:11; 1 Thess 5:12, 13; Heb 13:7, 17; Jas 5:14; cf. Lightfoot, Philippians, 194). This is to be expected, given the nature of the early church, which was not centralized in large meeting halls but distributed throughout a city in homes (cf. Titus 1:11).

Talk about the household codes.

The temple is referred to as the people of God and not a building.
