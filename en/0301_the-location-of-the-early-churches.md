# The social setting of the early churches

## Location

Immediately after the Day of Pentecost, we see the church started the practice of meeting every day in the house of one of its members and having a meal. Every day they would do this in someone else's house (Acts 2:46; 5:42). This practice of meeting in houses continued through all the New Testament. When Paul was in Ephesus, he acknowledged that the main way that the church spread doctrine was "from house to house" (Acts 20:20). Following is a list of people who had churches in their houses:

1. Aquila and Priscilla (1 Cor. 16:19; Rom. 16:3–5)
2. Nympha (Col. 4:15)
3. Philemon (Philemon 1:1–2)
4. Lydia (Acts 16:40)
5. Possibly Gaius (Rom. 16:23)

### Household codes

Because the early church met in houses, there are several times in the epistles that we see lists of rules for each person in the family (Eph. 5:21–6:9; Col. 3:18–4; 1 Pet. 2:18–3:7). These were called "household codes" and they were a common thing in the Roman world.

1 Timothy 5:1–2 tels us that we are to treat the people in the church as family members (See also Gal. 6:10; Heb. 13:1; 1 Pet. 2:17; 1 John 3:16).

### The church is people

The word church is never used in the New Testament to refer to a building, but it always refers to a group of people. We are the temple of the Holy Ghost (1 Cor. 6:19). We are the House of God, and not any building.

## Transition from Synagogues

We must remember that the church at first did not think of itself as a new religion, but as a continuation of the Jewish religion. Many times in the New Testament, the teachings of Christ started in the Jewish synagogues. Jesus himself taught in synagogues (Luke 4:15–16; Matt. 4:23) and so did Paul immediately after he became a Christian (Acts 9:20) and on his missionary journeys to Antioch of Pisidia (Acts 13:14–16), Iconium (Acts 14:1), Thessalonica (Acts 17:1–2), and Corinth (Acts 18:4).

James refers to the Christian assembly as a "synagogue" (James 2:2).

### Jewish Synagogue worship

We are not exactly sure what exactly happened in the synagogue as part of regular worship, there are some things we know from reading the New Testament:

1. A central element was reading of Scripture (Luke 4:16–20; Acts 13:15; 15:21).
2. After readings, there was often teaching and interpretation of the Scripture (Luke 4:20–27; Acts 13:15–16).
3. There was prayer (Matt. 6:5; Mark 12:40).
4. There were special seating arrangements for wealthy and important people (Matt. 23:6; James 2:2–3).
5. There were leaders in the synagogue, though we do not know exactly what their duties were (Luke 8:41; Mark 5:22; Acts 13:15).
6. Synagogue worship took place primarily on the Sabbath (Luke 4:16; Acts 13:14; 17:2).

### Christian adoption of Jewish worship

As we have said before, we do not know what worship in the early church was exactly like, either. We can assume that the early Christians that were Jewish brought some of their customs and ways of worship with them when they started forming their own places of worship. We see some ways how the early church continued in Jewish worship:

1. The church of Jerusalem met every day in the temple courts (Acts 2:46)
2. Peter and John went to the temple to pray (Acts 3:1)
3. Paul participated in the temple purification (Acts 21:26)
4. Paul still celebrated the Jewish festivals (Acts 20:6, 16)
5. Some Christians still worshipped on the Sabbath (Acts 20:7)

As time continued and more people that were not Jewish became a part of the church, the church slowly observed fewer of the Jewish practices.

## The meaning of the word "church"

The Greek word for _church_ is "Ekklesia." It means "those called out." As with many words used by the church in the New Testament, it was not original to the church, but had a meaning in natural life. The Ekklesia was a word used in civic government for city councils.

The same word is used for the church in a single house, all the house churches in a city, and the universal church. When we talk of the "church in Jerusalem" it was not one group of people, but several house churches who probably had some form of fellowship. Because there would be several house churches in one city, that is why the terms for leadership are usually plural (1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 4:11; 1 Thess. 5:12, 13; Heb. 13:7, 17; James 5:14).<sup>[1]</sup> There would be some leaders in each house church.

### The universal church

Ephesians 4:4 says that "there is one body," referring to the church. We know that this is true in a spiritual sense. God only has one church. But in a natural sense, there was probably never a time when there was a completely united group of people called the church. Paul writes most of his letters to combat false teaching or heal divisions in the church, so we see that even in the very beginning, there were divisions and corruptions in the church.

The elders and apostles wrote a letter in Acts 15 and sent it out to the churches, but who enforced it? They had no way to go to every place and make sure people followed their rules. We see that Paul later did not completely follow it or endorse it, since he taught that eating meat sacrificed to idols was not an issue.
