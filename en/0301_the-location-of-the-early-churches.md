# The location of the early churches

(Maybe the social setting of the early church)

In houses.

1 Corinthians 16:19 (KJV 1900)
19The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.

Acts 2, they went from house to house.

> Prisca and Aquila are recognized as having a church (assembly) that meets in their home (τὴν κατʼ οἶκον αὐτῶν ἐκκλησίαν, Rom. 16:5; 1 Cor. 16:19); Nympha hosts a church in her house (τὴν κατʼ οἶκον αὐτῆς ἐκκλησίαν, Col. 4:15); Philemon hosts a church in his house (τῇ κατʼ οἶκόν σου ἐκκλησίᾳ, Phlm. 2); and Gaius appears to have been a host both to Paul and to the whole Corinthian community (ὁ ξένος μου καὶ ὅλης τῆς ἐκκλησίας, Rom. 16:23)

> Throughout the NT the terms for leadership are usually plural (1 Cor 12:28; Eph 4:11; 1 Thess 5:12, 13; Heb 13:7, 17; Jas 5:14; cf. Lightfoot, Philippians, 194). This is to be expected, given the nature of the early church, which was not centralized in large meeting halls but distributed throughout a city in homes (cf. Titus 1:11).

Talk about the household codes.

The temple is referred to as the people of God and not a building.

<!--Ekklesia as a word used in civic government.-->

The universal church? "One body" in Ephesians. There was probably never one church. Paul writes most of his letters to combat false teaching or heal divisions in the church. The elders and apostles wrote a letter in Acts 15 and sent it out to the churches, but who enforced it? We see that Paul later did not completely follow it or endorse it, since he taught that eating meat sacrificed to idols was not an issue.

When we talk of the "church in Jerusalem" it was not one group of people, but several house churches who probably had some form of fellowship.
