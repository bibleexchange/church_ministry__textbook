# Leaders and money

### What is the purpose of offerings in the N.T. church?

#### It does not matter the amount of the offering, but the heart

> Mark 12:41-44
> 41 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.
> 42 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
> 43 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:
> 44 For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.

See also Luke 21:1-4.

Giving the offering is less important than other things:

> Matthew 23:23
> 23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

If our heart is not right, we should take care of that first before bringing an offering:

> Matthew 5:23-24
> 23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;
> 24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.

#### Give with no expect of return

We give offerings as thanks to what God has already done for us (2 Cor. 9:12).

Luke 6:38 is a major verse used in the prosperity gospel:

> Luke 6:38
> 38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.

If we read the verses around this, we see it is part of a larger conversation about how we interact with our neighbors and enemies (v. 24-37). Jesus said to give without expect of return (34-35). There is an aspect of judgment from God based on how we treat others. Because it says "it shall be given to you" does not necessarily mean kind for kind. When we give, God will give good things to us, though it is likely spiritual things and blessings in the new heaven and earth (Matthew 25:31-40).

<!-- Study further Matthew 19:29 and parallel passages in the synoptic Gospels. It looks like it promotes prosperity gospel -->

We give to find spiritual blessings:

> 1 Timothy 6:17-19
> 17 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
> 18 That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
> 19 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.

We cannot buy spiritual things (Acts 8:9, 13, 18-20).

#### We give to God and not so man can see

> Matthew 6:1-4
> 1 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
> 2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
> 3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
> 4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.

#### The offerings were for the poor

> Galatians 2:9–10 (TNIV)
> 9 James, Cephas and John, those esteemed as pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.
> 10 All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I had been eager to do all along.

> Acts 11:27–30 (TNIV)
> 27 During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
> 28 One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.)
> 29 The disciples, as each one was able, decided to provide help for the believers living in Judea.
> 30 This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.

Jesus told the rich young ruler to sell all that he had and give to the poor (Matthew 19:16-22).

1 Corinthians 16:1-2:

> “blessing,” and “divine service.”16 All of this together suggests that the “collection” was not some mere matter of money, but was for Paul an active response to the grace of God that not only ministered to the needs of God’s people but also became a kind of ministry to God himself, which resulted in thanksgiving toward God and in a bond of fellowship between “God’s people” across the Empire.

The continuation of the collection: 2 Cor. 8:4, 8:13; 9:1-12

> Romans 15:26–27 (TNIV)
> 26 For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the Lord’s people in Jerusalem.
> 27 They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews’ spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings.

Luke 3:11
"John answered, 'Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.'"

2 Corinthians 8:13-15
"Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality. At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. The goal is equality, as it is written: 'The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.'"

Acts 11:29-30
"The disciples, as each one was able, decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea. This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul."-->

### Should pastors get money for their work?

All the requirements for leaders in the church from 1 Timothy 3 and Titus say that the leader should not be greedy for money.

Paul had the right to get paid for his work as an apostle, but he chose not to:

> 1 Corinthians 9:6–18 (KJV 1900)
> 6 Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?
> 7 Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
> 8 Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?
> 9 For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?
> 10 Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.
> 11 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?
> 12 If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.
> 13 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?
> 14 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.
> 15 But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.
> 16 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!
> 17 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.
> 18 What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.

In v. 14, he is referring to when Jesus sent out the 72:

> Luke 10:1–7 (TNIV)
> 1 After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go.
> 2 He told them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.
> 3 Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.
> 4 Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road.
> 5 “When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’
> 6 If the head of the house loves peace, your peace will rest on that house; if not, it will return to you.
> 7 Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for workers deserve their wages. Do not move around from house to house.

See also Matt. 10:10

Paul could have taken money for himself, but instead he worked:

> 1 Thessalonians 2:9–10 (TNIV)
> 9 Surely you remember, brothers and sisters, our toil and hardship; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you.
> 10 You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous and blameless we were among you who believed.

> 2 Thessalonians 3:6–13 (TNIV)
> 6 In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers and sisters, to keep away from every believer who is idle and disruptive and does not live according to the teaching you received from us.
> 7 For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you,
> 8 nor did we eat anyone’s food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you.
> 9 We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate.
> 10 For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: “Anyone who is unwilling to work shall not eat.”
> 11 We hear that some among you are idle and disruptive. They are not busy; they are busybodies.
> 12 Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the bread they eat.
> 13 And as for you, brothers and sisters, never tire of doing what is good.

Acts 18:1-4 shows that Paul made tents to support himself.

We should not try to sell the gospel:

> 2 Corinthians 2:17 (TNIV)
> 17 Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as those sent from God.

### Church leaders should be willing to work with their hands

> For Paul’s manual labour, cf. 1 Cor. 4:12; 9:6; 1 Thess. 2:9; 2 Thess. 3:8; for his Christian ministry, cf. 1 Cor. 9:1; 15:10; Gal. 4:11; Phil. 1:22; 2:16; Col. 1:29; 1 Tim. 4:10; for the manual labour of others, cf. 1 Thess. 4:11; 2 Thess. 3:10–12; and, for the Christian ministry of others, cf.
