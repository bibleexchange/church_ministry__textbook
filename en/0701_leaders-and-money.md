# Leaders and money

## What is the purpose of offerings in the New Testament?

We must remember that today we use some words in a different way than they were used in the Old Testament. Today, when we say "offering," we mean money. In the Old Testament, the "offering" was not money, but animals, grain, fruit, or drinks.

The sacrificial system in the Old Testament included both regular (daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly) sacrifices and various occasional sacrifices:

1. **Daily Sacrifices**: Each offering consisted of a year-old male lamb, along with grain and drink offerings (Num. 28:3–8).
2. **Weekly Sacrifices**: Additional sacrifices were made on the Sabbath (Num. 28:9–10).
3. **Monthly Sacrifices**: At the beginning of each month (new moon), special sacrifices were offered (Num. 28:11–15).
4. **Annual Sacrifices**: Special sacrifices were prescribed for festivals throughout the year.
   - Passover/Unleavened Bread (Num. 28:16–25)
   - Festival of Weeks/Pentecost (Num. 28:26–31)
   - Festival of Trumpets (Num. 29:1–6)
   - Day of Atonement (Num. 29:7–11; Lev. 16)
   - Festival of Tabernacles (Num. 29:12–38)
5. Additionally, individuals would bring personal sacrifices for **various occasions** such as:
   - Sin and guilt offerings when they transgressed (Lev. 4–7)
   - Thanksgiving offerings for blessings received (Lev. 7:12–15)
   - Offerings related to vows (Num. 15:3)
   - Purification offerings after childbirth or illness (Lev. 12–15)

The offerings were for different purposes:

1. Atonement for sin (Lev. 4:20; 16:30)
2. Expressing gratitude (Lev. 7:12; Deut. 26:10)
3. Worship and devotion (Lev. 1:9; Ps. 51:19)
4. Fellowship with God (Lev. 7:15–16; Deut. 12:7)
5. Ritual purification (Lev. 12:6–7; 14:19–20)
6. Maintaining the sanctuary (Num. 18:8; Ex. 30:16)
7. Covenant renewal (Ex. 24:5–8; 2 Kings 23:3)

The priests and other Levites were not to have their own farms, so they depended on the tithes and offerings to survive. The main way that they lived was through the tithe, which was completely given to the Levites (Num. 18:21–28). The tithe would not be brought to the temple, but gathered together by the Levites in each town (Neh. 10:37–38). There was also a special tithe every three years that was not only for the Levites, but also for foreigners, orphans, and widows (Deut. 14:28–29). The priests in the temple also ate part of some of the offerings:

1. **Burnt Offerings**: These were completely consumed by fire on the altar, so nobody ate them (Lev. 1:9).
2. **Grain Offerings**: A portion was burned on the altar, but the remainder was given to the priests to eat (Lev. 6:16–18).
3. **Peace Offerings**: These were shared three ways. A portion was burned on the altar for God, certain parts were given to the priests (Lev. 7:31–34), and the remainder was eaten by the worshipper and their family.
4. **Sin Offerings**: For most sin offerings, the priests were to eat the meat in the sanctuary area (Lev. 6:26).
5. **Guilt Offerings**: Similar to sin offerings, the priests were to eat these in a holy place (Lev. 7:6).

<!--different levels of offerings based on if they were poor or rich-->

## What is the purpose of offerings in the New Testament church?

### The offerings were symbols that pointed forward to Christ

Many things in the temple worship were symbols that were fulfilled in the life and person of Christ. Jesus did not come to destroy the Law of Moses, but to fulfill it (Matt. 5:17–20). Because He fulfilled the Law, we no longer follow all the rules of sacrificing animals.

#### Christ offered His life for our sins

Jesus came as the Lamb of God, Who would take away the sin of the world (John 1:29; 1 Pet. 1:18–19). When Jesus died on the cross, He became the final sacrifice for sins (Heb. 9:26; 10:11–14).

#### We offer our lives to Christ

There were offerings of thanks in the Old Testament. For us as Christians, we do not just give a portion of our possessions as thanks, but we give our entire lives to God to use as He wills (Rom. 12:1). This includes **everything** we own, and not just a portion of it. When we give our possessions to help other people, they are like sacrifices to God (Heb. 13:16; Phil. 4:18). Our praise also is a sacrifice to God (Heb. 13:15; 1 Pet. 2:5).

The churches in Macedonia were poor, but they wanted to help the people in Judea who were poor and hungry because of famine. It was said of them that they gave themselves first to the Lord and then they gave themselves also to help the poor (2 Cor. 8:5). Later in this chapter, we will talk more about this famine and how the church helped in that time of trouble.

### It does not matter the amount of the offering, but the heart

In Mark 12:41–44, we see the story of when Jesus watched the people bring the money to give to the temple. Many people were bringing large amounts of money. There was one woman who gave only two small coins. This was not a big value, but it was **all she had**. Jesus told His disciples that this woman gave more than everyone else because she gave all that she had (See also Luke 21:1–4). Paul repeated this idea when he told the church in Corinth that "if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have" (2 Cor. 8:12).

Jesus said that it was good for people in the Jewish religion to give the tithe, but there were things that were more important, such as judgment, mercy, and faith (Matt. 23:23).

If our heart is not right, we should take care of that first before bringing a gift to God (Matt. 5:23–24).

When we give, we should make sure we have a good reason for giving in our heart. We should not give because we feel we have to, but we should give with a cheerful heart to be a blessing to God and to other people (2 Cor. 9:6–7).

#### Give with no expect of return

When we give to people, we give it as to God and we do not expect anything in return (Luke 6:35; 14:12–14). We do not give to get blessings, but we give to say thanks to God for what He has already done for us (2 Cor. 9:12).

There are many preachers that like to say that if you give money to God, then He will give you ten times that money back. Luke 6:38 is a major verse that they use to preach this:

> Luke 6:38 — Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.

If we read the verses around this, we see it is part of a larger conversation about how we interact with our neighbors and enemies (v. 24–37). Jesus said to give without expect of return (34–35). There is an aspect of judgment from God based on how we treat others. Because it says "it shall be given to you" does not necessarily mean kind for kind. When we give, God will give good things to us, though it is likely spiritual blessings (1 Tim. 6:17–19; Eph. 1:3; Acts 20:35). Psalm 41:1–3 also shows how God will bless those that give to the poor with protection and health.

Luke 14:14 says that when we give, we should not look for something in return immediately, but we "will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous." Matthew 25:31–35 also show that our reward for giving will be in the new heaven and earth.

While God may give us spiritual blessings, we are not buying them with our offerings. We cannot buy spiritual things (Acts 8:9, 13, 18–20).

<!--
Proverbs 19:17
"Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the LORD, and he will reward them for what they have done."
Deuteronomy 15:10
"Give generously to them and do so without a grudging heart; then because of this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to."-->

<!-- Study further Matthew 19:29 and parallel passages in the synoptic Gospels. It looks like it promotes prosperity gospel -->

#### God blesses us so we can give to others

If we do receive physical or financial blessings from God, they are not for us to keep for ourselves, but that we can keep giving (2 Cor. 9:8–11). Romans lists giving as one of the spiritual gifts, alongside prophesy and teaching (Rom. 12:8). There will be some people in the church that will be blessed with wealth so that they can help other people.

James warns the rich about the coming judgment because they did not help the poor (James 5:1–3) and so did Jesus (Matt. 25:41—46).

#### We give to God and not so man can see

Jesus taught that when we give, we should not give so that people can see (Matt. 6:1–4). We do not even let our left hand know what our right hand is doing. That means that we should give and forget about it. Do not go home and think that you are very righteous for your giving.

We see this attitude of people in weddings and send-offs. People will dance with their gift showing everyone what they are giving. But would they give the same thing if there was no one looking?

### The collections in the church were for the poor

<!-- Need to study on Greek words used for giving in the new testament. Ye olde Chat GPT gave me this:

In the New Testament, several Greek words are used to convey the concept of giving, each with distinct nuances. Here are some key Greek words related to giving:

    δίδωμι (didōmi) – This is the most common word for giving, meaning to bestow, grant, or offer. It appears frequently in the New Testament (e.g., Matthew 7:7, John 3:16, Acts 20:35).

    χαρίζομαι (charizomai) – Derived from charis (grace), it means to give freely, to grant as a favor, or to forgive (e.g., 2 Corinthians 2:7, Colossians 2:13).

    μεταδίδωμι (metadidōmi) – This word emphasizes sharing or imparting something with others, especially in generosity (e.g., Romans 12:8, Luke 3:11).

    παραδίδωμι (paradidōmi) – Often translated as deliver or hand over, this word can refer to giving in the sense of entrusting or yielding something (e.g., 1 Corinthians 11:23, referring to the Lord’s Supper).

    δωρέομαι (doreomai) – This verb means to grant or bestow as a gift, emphasizing the generosity of the giver (e.g., 2 Peter 1:3).

    δωρεά (dōrea) – A noun meaning gift, often used to refer to divine gifts, such as the gift of the Holy Spirit (e.g., Acts 2:38, Romans 5:15).

    ἀποδίδωμι (apodidōmi) – Meaning to give back or repay, used in contexts of reward, recompense, or returning something (e.g., Matthew 6:4, Luke 19:8).

    προσφέρω (prospherō) – Often used in the sense of offering a sacrifice or presenting something before God (e.g., Hebrews 9:14, Matthew 5:23).

    ἔκδιδωμι (ekdidōmi) – Less commonly used, meaning to give out or lease (e.g., Mark 12:1 in the Parable of the Vineyard).
-->

In the first century, there was a famine in Judea (Jerusalem and the surrounding cities and villages). The churches outside of Judea decided that they should help the people in Jerusalem, so they gave money to Paul and Barnabas to bring back to Jerusalem (Acts 11:27–30).

This was a very important task for the church. When the apostles in Jerusalem sent Paul and Barnabas to go preach to the gentiles, they told them to also make sure that they continue to remember the poor (Gal. 2:9–10). The work of preaching works together with the work of helping the poor.

The christians thought it was important to help the Jews in Judea because the Christians received a spiritual blessing from them. The Jews had been the keepers of the Word and covenant of God. Since the Jews gave a spiritual blessing, it was good to give them a natural blessing in return (Rom. 15:26–27).

In both letters to the Corinthians, Paul wrote to them about this collection:

1. They were to collect money on the first day of the week (1 Cor. 16:1).
2. Each person should give a sum of money keeping with their income. That is, those that were rich were expected to give more than those that were poor (1 Cor. 16:2; 2 Cor. 8:12).
3. Paul gave them testimony about how the churches in Macedonia gave:
   - They were poor, but still gave generously with "overflowing joy" (2 Cor. 8:1–2).
   - They gave as much as they were able to, even beyond their ability (2 Cor. 8:3).
   - They pleaded to be able share in "this service to the Lord’s people" (2 Cor. 8:4).
4. They excelled in spiritual gifts, so they should also excel in giving (2 Cor. 8:7).
5. Paul did not force them to give, but wanted them to give out of love (2 Cor. 8:8).
6. Jesus is our example in giving, because He was rich, but He became poor so that we could be rich (2 Cor. 8:9).
7. They had started giving the year before, and Paul encouraged them to help finish the project (2 Cor. 8:10–11).
8. The goal of the collection was equality. It would be difficult for the Corinthians to give to help the poor in Judea, but at the time the Judeans needed the money more than the Corinthians did. There might later come a time when the Corinthians churches need help and the Judean churches would be able to return the help (2 Cor. 8:13–15).
9. They should give as generously, and not grudgingly (2 Cor. 9:5, 7).
10. If they give little, they will receive little (2 Cor. 9:6).
11. If they give, God will increase their "store of seed" and "enlarge the harvest of [their] righteousness." This signifies both material and spiritual reward (2 Cor. 9:8–10).
12. The material reward that they get from God is so that they will be able to keep giving (2 Cor. 9:11).
13. Their giving not only helps people, but is a form of thanks to God (2 Cor. 9:12).
14. Their giving will also cause other people to give thanks to God (2 Cor. 9:13–15).

If you want to know more about the collection for the poor in Judea, read 1 Corinthians 16:1–4, 2 Corinthians 8:1–15, 9:1–15, and Acts 24:17.

This is the only specific time in the New Testament where we see the church asking for money, and it was not for themselves, but for other people who were poor.

<!--
> "blessing," and "divine service."16 All of this together suggests that the "collection" was not some mere matter of money, but was for Paul an active response to the grace of God that not only ministered to the needs of God’s people but also became a kind of ministry to God himself, which resulted in thanksgiving toward God and in a bond of fellowship between "God’s people" across the Empire.

### Not only do we give in a collection in the church, but we give to the poor when they ask

Sometimes we give in church and we think that we don't need to give any more. But the New Testament makes it clear that a large part of our giving should be our own personal contributions to the poor:

1. Give to him that asks (Matt. 5:42; Luke 6:30).
2. If you have two shirts, give to someone who has none (Luke 3:11).
3. Sell your possessions and give to the poor (Matt. 19:16–22; Luke 12:33–34).
4. We do not have the love of God if we do not help the poor (1 John 3:17–18).
5. It is not enough just to say spiritual words to people and not help them materially (James 2:15–16)

Dorcas is an example of a Christian who was always helping the poor (Acts 9:36).

## The church is supposed to share with each other

After the day of Pentecost, the believers shared all their possessions and gave what they did not need to the poor (Acts 2:44–45; 4:34–35). They sold their land and gave the money to the apostles to use to help the poor.

There was a married couple named Ananias and Sapphira. They sold their land to bring the money to the apostles. They wanted to keep some of the money, but they also wanted the recognition for giving all their money to the poor. They lied and said that what they brought was all the money. Because of their lying, they died. Their sin was not keeping something back, but lying about it. This teaches us that this giving is voluntary. God wants us to give because we want to, and not because we are forced to (Acts 5:1–11).

Paul encouraged the church to help each other (Rom. 12:13; Gal. 6:9–10). His goal was that there would be equality in the church (2 Cor. 8:13–15).

## Should pastors get money for their work?

We saw that in the Old Testament, the Levites did not own lands or farms, so they needed the tithes and offerings to live. But what does that mean for the New Testament? We have also seen that leaders come from God and are good for the building up of the church. If they are doing the work of God, how will they find the way to live?

### Leaders should not be looking for money

In all three of the lists of requirements for leaders in 1 Timothy chapter three and Titus chapter one say that the leader "should not be greedy for money" (1 Tim. 3:3, 8; Titus 1:7) and Peter also agreed with this (1 Pet. 5:2).

This is because money is dangerous. 1 Timothy 6:6–10 teaches that the love of money is the root of all evil. Jesus said that it is very hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of God (Mark 10:23–25). This is because if we already have all that we need, then we will not trust in God to help us (Luke 6:24; Pro. 30:7–9).

### We should not try to sell the gospel

There were some false teachers who tried to make a profit off the Gospel (1 Tim. 6:5; Titus 1:11). This is not good because salvation is a gift from God (Rom. 3:23–24; 5:15–17; 6:23; 2 Cor. 9:15; Eph. 2:8–9; 1 Pet. 1:18–19; Rev. 22:17). Jesus said that we should freely give, because we have freely received (Matt. 10:8). We do not sell the Word of God for profit (2 Cor. 2:17).

### In theory, it is good for church workers to find money for their labor

Paul taught that it was good to take care of leaders in the church. He quotes from
Deuteronomy 25:4 and says "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain" and from Deuteronomy 24:15 when he says "Workers deserve their wages" (1 Tim. 5:17–18). If we receive instruction from teachers, then it is good to give material things back to them (Gal. 6:6).

<!--Maybe expand on this with 1 Cor. 9:6–13. It gives a lot more examples of why someone should expect return for their work.-->

Jesus received help to do His ministry (Luke 8:1–3). Jesus told the twelve (Matt. 10:5–15) and the seventy (Luke 10:4–5) to not bring money with them when they traveled. They were supposed to depend on other people to take care of them.

The early church fathers believed that it was good to help the prophets, as they say in Didache 13:1–7:

> But every true prophet who wishes to settle among you is "worthy of his food." Likewise a true teacher is himself worthy, like the workman, of his food. Therefore thou shalt take the firstfruit of the produce of the winepress and of the threshing-floor and of oxen and sheep, and shalt give them as the firstfruits to the prophets, for they are your high priests. But if you have not a prophet, give to the poor. If thou makest bread, take the firstfruits, and give it according to the commandment. Likewise when thou openest a jar of wine or oil, give the firstfruits to the prophets. Of money also and clothes, and of all your possessions, take the firstfruits, as it seem best to you, and give according to the commandment.<sup>[1]</sup>

### Paul chose not to use this right

After reading those Scriptures, it would seem that the answer is clear: "It is good to give to church workers." The problem is, we know from Scripture that just because something is good to do, doesn't mean that it is always best that we do that thing (1 Cor. 10:23).

Paul recognized that it was his right to receive for doing the work of the Gospel, but he chose not to use that right (1 Cor. 9:14–18. For more clarification, also read verses 6–13). In verse 14, he is referring to when Jesus sent out the seventy (Luke 10:1–7).

Why did Paul choose to not take money? He did not want to hinder the Gospel (1 Cor. 9:12). He thought that if he took money, then in the mind of some people, they would think he was only doing the ministry for the money. This would make the Gospel void (1 Corinthians 9:15).

> 1 Corinthians 9:18 — What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.

He also knew that some of the churches that he visited were poor, and he did not want to be a burden to them (2 Cor. 11:8–9; 1 Thess. 2:9–10).

### Church leaders should be willing to work with their hands

Paul could have taken money for himself, but instead he worked. Paul was a tent maker, and even when he was on his missionary trips, he could stop in one place and work to find money to live (Acts 18:1–4; 20:33–35). When he was in Thessalonica, he did not eat anyone's food without paying for it (2 Thess. 3:8). He hoped that by working, the people would see his example and stop being idle (2 Thess. 3:6–13).

Didache 12:1–5 says something similar to the teaching of Paul:

> Let everyone who "comes in the Name of the Lord" be received; but when you have tested him you shall know him, for you shall have understanding of true and false. If he who comes is a traveller, help him as much as you can, but he shall not remain with you more than two days, or, if need be, three. And if he wishes to settle among you and has a craft, let him work for his bread. But if he has no craft provide for him according to your understanding, so that no man shall live among you in idleness because he is a Christian. But if he will not do so, he is making traffic of Christ; beware of such.<sup>[2]</sup>
